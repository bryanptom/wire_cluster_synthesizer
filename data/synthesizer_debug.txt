-Police today questioned a man they declined to name in connection with the merciless slaying of lovely blonde Dana Marie Weaver, 16-year-old high school junior. Officers would say only that the man was arrested several weeks ago on charges of accosting women in the vicinity of Christ Episcopal church parish house, where the young girl was beaten and strangled to death Sunday. The man was free on bond pending trial, police said. Detective Capt. Frank H. Webb described the questioning as 'routine.' But he said he was working on a 'definite possibility' that the blonde Jefferson high school girl was attacked 'by a would-be rapist who saw her enter the parish house alone.' Coroner Charles M. Irvin said he had determined that the girl had not been raped. He added that an autopsy would be performed, probably today. Webb said police also are working on a possibility that jealousy may have been the motive for the slaying that followed an almost maniacal battle. The detective captain said as far as he has been able to learn, the popular young beauty had no steady boy friend. But he said some high school youth may have quarreled with her in the parish house kitchen after she returned from a date with Virginia Tech students Sunday afternoon, He said soft drinks spilled on the floor indicated that the girl may have been drinking pop with someone she knew just before she was killed. He said there were cigarette butts on the floor but none of them bore lipstick stains. Police

-Police today questioned a man they declined to name in connection with the merciless slaying of lovely blonde Dana Marie Weaver, 16-year-old high school junior. Officers would say only that the man was arrested several weeks ago on charges of accosting women in the vicinity of Christ Episcopal church parish house, where the young girl was beaten and strangled to death Sunday. The man was free on bond pending trial, police said. Detective Capt. Frank H. Webb described the questioning as 'routine.' But he said he was working on a 'definite possibility' that the blonde Jefferson high school girl was attacked 'by a would-be rapist who saw her enter the parish house alone.' Coroner Charles M. Irvin said he had determined that the girl had not been raped. He added that an autopsy would be performed, probably today. Webb said police also are working on a possibility that jealousy may have been the motive for the slaying that followed an almost maniacal battle. The detective captain said as far as he has been able to learn, the popular young beauty had no steady boy friend. But he said some high school youth may have quarreled with her in the parish house kitchen after she returned from a date with Virginia Tech students Sunday afternoon, He said soft drinks spilled on the floor indicated that the girl may have been drinking pop with someone she knew just before she was killed.
