In adition to its application to U.S.-Soviet relations, the agreement applies also to the relations of either party with other countries. In this way, although technically bilateral, the agreement has multilateral implications. The two leaders declared in the agreement that they were conscious that nuclear war would have devastating consequences for mankind and said they wanted to. bring about conditions in which the danger of an outbreak of nuclear war anywhere in the world would be reduced and ultimately eliminated. They pledged their countries to act in such a way as to prevent the development of situations capable of causing a dangerous exacerbation of their relations, as to avoid military confrontations. and as to exclude the outbreak of nuclear war between them and between either of the parties and other countries. Nixon and  Brezhnev also agreed that their countries will refrain from the threat or the use of force against the other party, against the allies of the other party and against other countries, in circumstances which may endanger  international peace and security. At a news conference prior to the formal signing, presidential assistant Henry A. Kissinger skirted questions on whether this clause would forbid U.S. bombing of Cambodia or would have prevented the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Kissinger noted, however, that U.S. air strikes against Communist forces in Cambodia were under way at the time the agreement was being negotiated and that the bombing was not raised as applying to that particular situation. When a newsman  asked whether the agreement would forestall any Soviet action against China, Kissinger responded that the accord was not conceived as  protection for any country but added it would have the practical consequence of applying to the situation you described.

Moore and  other Texas poultrymen say that President Nixons latest 60-day price freeze on retail food products has left them unable to meet rising feed grain prices. Feed grains, a raw agricultural commodity, were not covered by the freeze. Texas ranked sixth in U.S. broiler production last year, according to Bill Cawley, poultry specialist for the Texas AM University Extension Service. Cawley says that about 200 million chickens were produced in Texas in 1972. Cawley says that official State statistics on eggs set for hatching show a sharp decline since the price freeze. The latest figures, for the week of June 16, were down 14 per cent from last year and 10 per cent from the previous week. Gene Biddle, president of Rite-Care Poultry Co. of Tenaha, Tex., said he is destroying hatching eggs to reduce his weekly output by more than 15 per cent. There is no way we can produce broilers at current feed price levels, Biddle said. Bo Pilgrim of Pittsburgh, Tex., a major poultry distributor to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, says he is cutting back 100,000 broilers per week, or about 13 per cent of production. Feed grain prices have doubled in the past year, the poultrymen say. Soybeans cost about 100 a ton last year but are now more than 400 a ton, Biddle said. The price of corn has doubled. A severe shortage could occur in 8 to 12 weeks, when the eggs and chicks now being destroyed would have been ready for market, the growers say.

Moore, says his growers will have destroyed 200,000 chickens by the end of this week, Theres nothing left to dc but drown them, he said. Moore, president of Home Foods of Nixon, Tex., said he lost 72,000 on poultry las week. Broilers cost about 45-5 cents a pound to raise, anc bring only 40 to 41 cents at market. Moore and other Texas poultrymen say that the Presidents latest 60-day price freeze on retail food products has left them unable to meet skyrocketing feed grain prices. The feed grains, a raw agricultural commodity, were not covered by the freeze. Gene Biddle, president of Rite-Care Poultry Co, of Te naha, Tex., said he is destroy ing hatching eggs to reduce his weekly output by more than Li per cent, There is nO way we can pro duce broilers at current feec price levels, Biddle said, He estimates that he produces about 10 per cent of all Texas broilers, mostly distributed to the Gulf Coast area, Bo Pilgrim of Pittsburgh, Tex., whose Pilgrim Industries is a major poultry distributor to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, says he is cutting back 100,000 broilers per week, or about 13 per cent of production. The question has become, How do we survive Pilgrim said, The broiler industry was caught at the lowest point of a 90-day price cycle when the latest freeze was imposed, he said, Producers who must buy feed grains at the current market price must spend about 50 cents per pound to raise a broiler for market. The market price is about 10 cents less, he said. Texas was about No. 6 in U.S. broiler production last year, according to Bill Cawley, poultry specialist for the Texas AM --iUniversity Extension Service, Cawley says that about 200 million chickens were pro. duced. The growers say this number will be greatly reduced. A se vere shortage could occur in  to 12 weeks, when the eggs anc chicks now being destroyec would have been ready far market, they say. Moore, who was  producing about 65,000 broilers a day last year, expects his output to be cut in half. Biddle says he will have a 20 per cent overall cutback. Roy Herider, owner of Herider Farms at WNacogdoches, Tex., says he is cutting back about 25 per cent of his broiler production. If retail price controls were removed the consumer might have to pay as much as 20 per cent more for broilers, Biddle said. He said his estimate was based on market response tc smaller reductions in poultry

He spoke as an assistant to special Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox said a special grand jury may be convened to investigate whether President Nixons fund raisers used extorlion to get campaign contributions. Prosecutors are investigating, among other things, reports that the Presidents men vigorously solicited money from businessmen and other individuals involved in tax problems, securities investigations, contract disputes and other sensitive governmental dealings. In a related development, Mitchells wife, Martha, who has complained of being besieged by newsmen, left her Fifth Avenue apartment in New York in a station wagon loaded with suitcases. Mrs. Mitchell complained Tuesday night about reporters clustered about her apartment building entrance. It was not immediately known where she was headed, In Indianapolis, Sen. Barry Goldwater told a Republican gathering, Your President will not resign and will not be impeached. Goldwater, speaking at a 100-a-plate dinner Thursday night, told Republicans their party has been badly damaged by Watergate, but he said it is not the time to roll over and play dead. Republicans must remove the. temporary blot of Watergate even if it takes the caustic cleanser of public embarrassment, he said.

LONDON AP -The U.S. dollar dropped to a record low against the West German mark in Frankfurt today and weakened in other European centers. Frankfurt dealers said the dollar was under selling pressure from New York, and from traders hedging against weekend uncertainties. Dealers in Europe attributed the dollar weakness largely to the effect of the Watergate scandal on the Nixon administration and to inflation in the United States. THE HAGUE AP -The International Court of Justice called on France today to refrain from nuclear testing in the South Pacific pending a final decision on the legality of the test series. The courts ruling followed applications last month by Australia and New Zeland seeking an injunction against the French test series. In their pleadings before the court, representatives of both the Australian and New Zealand governments said further nuclear tests in the South Pacific would present unacceptable health and environmental dangers to the population of the areas concerned.

Medical requirements dictated the pick up method today. Medical experts were not certain how the astronauts would react after returning to earths gravity following record exposure to space weightlessness so they decided the astronauts should be subjected to as little activity as possible until. they can be examined in moble medica laboratories on the Ticonderoga. The landing completed an historic space mission that lasted 28 days and 50 minutes. During that time the spacemen circled the earth 395 times.

The wobbly 60 steps from the Apollo ferry ship to a medical laboratory indicated Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz had suffered some effects from a record four weeks exposure to space weightlessness. But Commander Conrad reported as the Apollo parachuted toward a pinpoint landing in the Pacific after an 11-millionmile journey Were all in good shape. Everythings OK.

Frogmen immediately leaped from helicopters to secure the spacecraft with flotation collars, The Ticonderoga steamed to pick up the Apollo capsule with the astronauts still inside, in contrast to most earlier U.S. flights when the spacemen were lifted to the carrier by helicopter. Medical requirements dictated the pick up method today, Medical experts were not certain how the astronauts would react after returning to earths gravity following record ex. posure to space weightlessness so they decided the astronauts should be subjected to as little activity as possible until they can be examined in mobile medical laboratories aboard the Ticonderoga. The landing completed an historic space mission that lasted 22 days and 50 minutes. During that time the spacemen circled the earth 395 times. Misson Control was kept in suspense for most of the final 76 minutes of the flight -a period when the Apollo ship was out of radio contact with ground stations. The Ticondergas radar picked up the streaking craft at a distance of 188 miles, 10 minutes before landing, While out of radio contact, at 911 am., the astronauts conducted the critical retrorocket burn that slowed their 17,100 mile-an-hour speed by 150 miles, allowing earths gravity to tug the spacecraft out of orbit and start the long glide through the atmosphere to the eastern Pacific, The refrigeration  trouble caused considerable concern. A maneuver intended to correct it caused a brief gyroscope problem that caused the 10-minute delay in the astronauts departure from the orbiting laboratory.

After the undocking, the estronauts made a 45-minute flyaround inspection of the station, televising pictures of the odd-locking space vehicle to mission control for evaluation by experts. Then, in quick succession, they triggered the engine firings that gradualy dropped them closer to earth from their original orbital altitude of 275 miles.

The Ticonderoga reported the astronauts had landed 612 miles from the ship and that the ship was 62 miles from the target point, indicating a perfect touchdown. The Ticonderoga steamed to pick up the Apollo capsule with the astronauts still inside, in contrast to most earlier U.S. flights when the spacemen were lifted to the carrier by helicopter. Medical requirements dictated the pick up method today. Medical experts were not certain how the astronauts would react after returning to earths gravity following record exposure to space weightlessness so  they decided the astronauts should be subjected to as little activity as possible until they can be examined in mobile medical laboratories aboard the Ticonderoga. The landing completed an historic space mission that lasted 28 days and 50 minutes. During that time the spacemen circled the earth 395 times. Misson Control was kept in suspense for most of the final 76 minutes of the flight -a period when the Apollo ship was out of radio contact with ground stations. The Ticonderogas radar picked up the streaking craft at a distance of 188 miles, 10 minutes before landing. While out of radio contact, at 911 a.m., the astronauts conducted the  critical retrorocket burn that slowed their 17,100 mile-an-hour speed by 130 miles, allowing earths gravity to tug the spacecraft out of orbit and start the long glide through the atmosphere to the eastern Pacific. The refrigeration trouble caused considerable concern. A maneuver intended to correct it caused a brief gyroscope problem that caused the 10-minute delay in the astronauts departure from the orbiting laboratory. Were free, Conrad reported seconds after the control center flashed the goahead for undocking from the 118-footlong laboratory. They left behind a space station which they had salvaged with some daring, difficult and often ingenious repair tasks after it was damaged during launching May 14. After the undocking, the astronauts made a 45-minute flyaround inspection of the station, televising pictures of the odd-looking space vehicle to mission control for evaluation by experts. Then, in quick succession, they triggered the engine firings that gradually dropped them closer to earth from their original orbital altitude of 275 miles.

ABOARD USS TICONDEROGA AP -Skylabs astro nauts came home safely today from mans longest space journey and shunned stretchers to walk smartly but unsteadily across the deck of this recovery carrier. The wobbly 60 steps from the Apollo ferry ship to a medical laboratory indicated Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz had suffered some effects from a record four weeks exposure to space weightlessness. But Commander Conrad reported as the Apollo parachuted toward a pinpoint landing in the Pacific after an 11-millionmile journey Were all in good shape. Everythings OK. They splashed down right on target, just 642 miles from the Ticonderoga Thirty-nine minutes later, still inside the Apollo, they were on the carrier deck. Doctors, not knowing how they might react to earths gravity after their long weightless exposure, were prepared to lift them out on litters. But, after consultation with doctors, Kerwin, a physician, said they could walk to the medical trailer where they began six hours of extensive medical debriefing. They emerged smiling from the hatch and saluted as the ships band struck up Anchors Aweigh for the all-Navy crew. Conrad walked with hesitant steps at first but gradually picked up steam as he reached the medical lab door. Kerwin was slightly stooped and both he and Weitz were somewhat unsteady in their steps. Doctors assisted both Kerwin and Weitz by holding onto one arm of each. Experts immediately began removing thousands of feet of film and tape and equipment from medical, earth resources and astronomy experiments that may tell man much about his earth, his sun and his physiCai deing. How well Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz fared in the weightless world will play a major role in determining if man can function efficiently in future long. duration flights. The first of the two 56lay Skylab missions is scheduled for launch July 27. The astronauts almost were held over in orbit today to try to repair a refrigeration problem in their space station. But Mission Control decided there was nothing the astronauts could do and told them to come home. Ten minutes behind schedule, Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz undocked their Apollo ferry ship and executed a series of maneuvers that sent them slamming into the atmosphere above Thailand for the fiery deseent, The Apollo craft hit the calm blue waters at 950 a.m. EDT about 830 miles southwest of San Diego, Calif.

To get the astronauts to medical trailers on board as quickly as possible after landing, the carrier was to steam to the Apollo capsule and hoist it on deck with a crane. In earlier U.S. manned space flights, the astronauts were plucked by helicopter from their floating spaceships. Speed in retrieving the astronauts is essential because doctors are keenly interested in their initial reaction to earth gravity after four weeks exposure to weightlessness. In general, the three crewmen are in good health, said Dr. Royce Hawkins, the astronauts chief physician, Thursday. The re-entry stress and reintroduction to gravity is the eritieal period in question now. Testing just how well man can withstand the deconditioning effects of living for long periods in space is one of the main objectives of the Skylab program. Two more missions are. planned, with. the Skylab 2 and 3 crews scheduled to rocket up to the laboratory on July 27 and in October. Theyll remain aboard for 56 days each, continuing the medical, earth resources, solar astronomy, space manufacturing and other experiments started by the first crew.

They left behind a space station which they had salvaged with some daring, difficult and often ingenious repair tasks after it was damaged during launching May 14. After the undocking, the astronauts made a 45-minute flyaround inspection of the station, televising pictures of the odd-looking space vehicle to mission control for evaluation by experts. Then, in quick succession, they triggered the engine firings that gradually dropped them closer to earth from their original orbital altitude of 275 miles. Two more missions are planned, with the Skylab 2 and 3 crews scheduled to rocket up to the laboratory on July 27 and in October Theyll remain aboard for 56 days each, continuing the medical, earth resources, solar astronomy, space manufacturing and other experiments started by the first crew. Like vacationers closing a summer house, Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz on Thursday cleaned up the space station for Skylab 2. They slept five hours and wakened at 830 p.m. to start a long re-entry day. They transferred into the Apollo ship and checked its systems for several hours. Packed aboard the Apollo are thousands of feet of film and tapes, plus other experiment equipment that experts will be analyzing for months in efforts to set guidelines for future long-duration space flights. Along the way, the crew set a record for a single manned space mission, breaking a mark of 23 days, 18 hours, 22 minutes set in 1971 by three Russian cosmonauts.

Fiery Descent So 10 minutes behind schedule Conrad, Dr. Joseph Kerwin and Paul Weitz undocked their Apollo ferry ship from the station and executed a series of maneuvers that sent them slamming into the atmosphere above Thailand for a fiery descent. The Apollo craft hit the calm Pacific waters at 850 a.m. CDT about 830 miles southwest of San Diego, Calif., within sight of the main recovery ship, the USS Ticonderoga. Everyones in super shape, Conrad said as the The Ticonderoga steamed to pick up the Apollo capsule with ithe astronauts still inside, in jcontrast to most earlier U.S. flights when the spacemen were lifted to the carrier by helicopter. Medical requirements dictated the pick up method Friday. Just 39 minutes after touchdown, the astronauts were hoisted onto the deck of this recovery carrier, still inside their Apollo ferry ship. Ten minutes later they climbed through the hatch, and walked unsteadily toward a mobile medical laboratory, showing some effects from four weeks of weightlessness. On Litters Doctors, not knowing how they might react to earths gravity after their long weightless exposure, were prepared to lift them out on litters. But, after consultation with doctors, Kerwin, a physician, said they could walk to the medical trailer where they began six hours of extensive medical debriefing. The fact that they were able to walk as well as they did was significant. It meant the three Americans were in better shape after spending 28 days in space than two Russian cosmonauts were at the end of an 18-day flight in 1970. They had to be carried from their spacecraft. Kerwin and Weitz reported some dizziness after splashdown and Kerwin inflated a pair of pressure pants to keep his blood pressure from dropping to the point where he might faint.

Then, in quick succession, they triggered the engine firings that gradually mag er ped them closer to earth from ir ---orbital altitude of 275 miles To get the astronauts to medical trailers on board as ow a as possible after landing, was to steam to the -capsule and hoist it on deck with a crane. In earlier U.S. manned space flights, the astronauts were plucked by helicopter from their floating spaceships. Speed in retrieving the astronauts is essential because doctors are keenly interested in their initial reaction to earth gravity after four weeks exposure to weightlessness. In general, the three crewmen are in good health, said Dr. Royce Hawkins, the astronauts chief physician, Thursday. The re-entry stress and reintroduction to gravity is the critical period in question now. Testing just how well man can withstand the deconditioning effects of living for long periods in space is one of the main objectives of the Skylab program. Two more missions are planned, with the Skylab 2 and 3 crews scheduled to rocket up to the laboratory on July 27 and in October. Theyll remain aboard for 56 days each, continuing the medical, earth resources, solar astronomy, space manufacturing and other experiments started by the first crew. Like vacationers closing a summer house, Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz on Thursday cleaned up the ce station for Skylab 2. They slept five hours and wakened at 830 p.m. to start a long re-entry day. They transferred into the Apollo ship and checked its systems for several hours. The Golden Triangle will revel in very pleasant weekend weather, according to the latest forecasts. See page 8.
ABOARD USS  TICONDEROGA AP -Skylabs astronauts came home safely from mans longest space journey today and despite some early dizziness and lightheadedness, they were pronounced in excellent physical condition. Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz shunned stretchers to walk somewhat unsteadily across the deck of this recovery carrier. The wobbly 60 steps from the Apollo ferry ship to a medical laboratory indicated the astronauts had suffered some initial effects in gravity after a record four weeks exposure to space weightlessness. But commander Conrad reported as the Apollo parachuted toward a pinpoint landing in the Pacific after an 11-millionmile journey Were all in good shape. Everythings OK. Dr. Royce Hawkins, the astronauts chief physician, confirmed this after consulting with doctors on the carrier. He told newsmen at the Houston Space Center They look quite good. They appear far better than I expected. Theyre excellent. Hawkins said Conrad, a veteran of three previous space flights, was in the best condition, with normal blood pressure and pulse and only slight lightheadedness. He said both Kerwin and Weitz suffered from dizziness and lightheadedness and  that Weitz blood pressure at first was on the low side. After splashdown Kerwin blew up an inflatable suit over the lower part of his body to help increase blood circulation, Hawkins said. The astronauts splashed down right on target, just 642 miles from the Ticonderoga. Thirty-nine minutes later, still inside the Apollo, they were on the carrier deck. Doctors, not knowing how they might react to earths gravity after their long weightless exposure, were prepared to lift them out on litters. But, after consultation with doctors, Kerwin, a physician, said they could walk to the medical trailer where they began six hours of extensive medical debriefing. They emerged smiling from the hatch and saluted as the ships band struck up Anchors Aweigh for the all-Navy crew. Conrad walked with hesitant steps at first but gradually picked up steam as he reached the medical lab door. Kerwin was slightly stooped and both he and Weitz were somewhat unsteady in their steps. Doctors assisted both Kerwin and Weitz by holding onto one arm of each. Experts immediately began removing thousands of feet of film and tape and equipment from medical, earth resources and astronomy experiments that may tell man much about his earth, his sun and his physical being.

Weitz undocked their Apollo ferry ship from the station and executed a series of maneuvers that sent them slamming into the atmosphere above Thailand for a fiery, descent. The Apollo craft hit. the calm Pacifie waters at  850 .a.m. CDT about 830 miles southwest of San Diego, Calif., within sight of the main recovery ship, the USS Ticonderoga. It was just after dawn off the West Coast. Hundreds of white-clad sailors on deck and millions watching television around the world again had a ringside sat to a U.S. man-in-space landing as the Apollo craft floated down through low-hanging clouds and dangling under three huge orange and white parachutes,  Everyones in super shape, Conrad said as the spacecraft bobbed on the water awaiting pickup. Frogmen immediately leaped from helicopters to secure the spacecraft with flotation collars. The Ticonderoga reported the astronauts had landed 6 miles from the ship and that the ship was 6 miles from the target point, indicating aperfect touchdown. The Ticonderoga steamed to  pick up the Apollo capsule with the astronauts still inside, in contrast to most earlier U.S. flights when the spacemen were lifted to the carrier by helicopter. Medical requirements dictated the pick up method today. Medical experts were not certain how the astronauts would react after returning to earths gravity following record exposure in space weightlessness so they decided the astronauts should be subjected to as little activity as possible until they can be examined in mobile medical laboratories aboard the Ticonderoga. The landing completed an historic space mission that lasted 28 days and 50 minutes. During that time the spacemen circled the earth 395 times. Misson Control was kept in suspense for most of the final 76 minutes of the flight -a period when the Apollo ship was out of radio contact with ground stations. The Ticonderogas radar picked up the streaking craft at a distance of 188 miles, 10 minutes before landing. While out of radio contact, at 811 a.m., the astronauts conducted the critical retrorocket burn that slowed their 17,100 mile-an-hour speed by 130 miles, allowing earths gravity to tug the spacecraft out of orbit and start the long glide through the atmosphere to the eastern Pacific. i The refrigeration trouble caused considerable concern. A maneuver intended to correct it caused a brief gyroscope problem that caused the 10-minute delay in the astronauts depar

Hawkins said Conrad, a veteran of three previous space flights, was in the best condition, with normal blood pressure and pulse and only slight lightheadedness. He said both Kerwin and Weitz suffered from dizziness and lightheadedness and that Weitz blood pressure at first was on the low side. After splashdown Kerwin blew up an inflatable suit over the lower part of his body to help increase blood circulation, Hawkins said. slightly stooped and both he and Weitz were somewhat unsteady in their steps. Doctors assisted both Kerwin and Weitz by holding onto one arm of each. Experts immediately began removing thousands of feet of film and tape and equipment from medical, earth resources and astronomy experiments that may tell man much about his earth, his sun and his physical being. How well Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz fared in the weightless world will play a major role in determining if man can function efficiently in future longduration flights. The first of the two 56day Skylab missions is scheduled for Jaunch July 27. Then, im quick succession, they triggered the engine firings that gradually dropped them closer to earth from their original orbital altitude of 275 miles. To get the astronauts to medical trailers on board as quickly as possible after landing, the carrier was to steam to the Apollo capsule and hoist it on deck with a crane. In earlier U.S. manned space flights, the astronauts were plucked by helicopter from their floating spaceships. Speed in retrieving the astronauts is essential because doctors are keenly interested in their initial reaction to earth gravity after four weeks exposure to weightlessness. In general, the three crewmen are in good health, said Dr. Royce Hawkins, the astronauts chief ohvsician, Thursday. lesting just how well man can withstand the deconditioning effects of living for long periods in space is one of the main obiectives of the Skylab program. Two more missions are planned, with the Skylab 2 and 3 crews scheduled to rocket up to the laboratory on July 27 and in October. Theyll remain aboard for 56 days each, continuing the medical, earth resources, solar astronomy, space manufacturing and other experiments started by the first crew. Like vacationers closing a summer house, Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz on Thursday cleaned up the space station for Skylab 2. They slept five hours and wakened at 830 p.m. to Start a long re-entry day They transferred into the Apollo ship and checked its systems for several hours. Packed aboard the Apollo are thousands of feet of film and tapes, plus other experiment equipment that experts will be analyzing for months in efforts to set guidelines for future long-duration space flights. Along the way, the crew set a record for a single manned space mission, breaking a mark of 23 days, 18 hours, 22 minutes set in 1971 by three Russian cosmonauts. That flight ended tragically when the cosmonauts died during re-entry because of a faulty hatch seal.

ABOARD USS TICONDEROGA AP -Skylabs astronauts came home safely from mans longest space journey today and despite some early dizziness and lightheadedness, they were pronounced in excellent physical conditon. Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz shunned stretchers to walk somewhat unsteadily across the deck of this recovery carrier. The wobbly 60 steps from the Apollo ferry ship to a medical laboratory indicated the astronauts had suffered some initial effects in gravity after a record four weeks exposure to space weightlessness. But commander Conrad reported as the Apollo parachuted toward a pinpoint landing in er Be ws after an 11-millionjourney Were all in pra shape. Everythings OK. The astronauts almost were held over in orbit to try to repair a refrigeration problem in their space station. But Mission Control decided there was nothing the astronauts could do and told them to come home. So, 10 minutes behind schedule, Conrad, Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz undocked their Apollo ferry ship from the station and executed a series of maneuvers that sent them slamming into the atmosphere above Thailand for a fiery descent. The Apollo craft hit the calm Pacific waters at 850 a.m. CDT about 830 miles southwest of San Diego, Calif., within sight of the main recovery ship, the USS Ticonderoga. It was just after dawn off the West Coast. Hundreds of white-clad sailors on deck and millions watching television around the world again had a ringside seat to a U.S. man-in-space landing as the Apollo craft floated down through low-hanging clouds and dangling under three huge orange and white parachutes. Everyones in super shape, Conrad said as the spacecraft bobbed on the water awaiting pickup. Frogmen immediately leaped from helicopters to secure the spacecraft with flotation collars. The Ticonderoga reported the astronauts had landed 612 miles from the ship and that the ship was 6 miles from the target point, indicating a perfect touchdown, The Ticonderoga steamed to pick up the Apollo capsule with the astronauts still inside, in contrast to most earlier U. S. flights when the spacemen were lifted to the carrier by helicopter. Medical requirements dictated the pick up method today. Medical experts were not certain how the astronauts would react after returning to earths gravity following record exposure in space weightlessness so they decided the astronauts should be subjected to as little activity as possible until they can be examined in mobile medical laboratories aboard the Ticonderoga. The landing completed an historic space mission that lasted 28 days and 50 minutes. During that time the spacemen circled the earth 395 times. Misson Control was kept in suspense for most of the final 76 minutes of the flight -a period when the Apollo ship was out of radio contact with ground stations. The Ticonderogas radar picked up the streaking craft at. a distance of 188 miles, 10 minutes before landing. While out of radio contact, at 811 a.m., the astronauts conducted the critical retrorocket burn that slowed their 17,100 mile-an-hour speed by 130 miles, allowing earths gravity to tug the spacecraft out of orbit and start the long glide through the atmosphere to the eastern Pacific. The refrigeration  trouble caused considerable concern. A maneuver intended to correct it caused a brief gyroscope problem that caused the 10-minute delay in the astronauts depar
ABOARD USS TICONDEROGA AP -Skylabs astronauts came home from mans longest space voyage today, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean after almost being held over in orbit to try to repair a faulty system in their space station. Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz ended their 28-day jourmey when their Apollo ferry ship parachuted into the water. The main recovery ship, the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga, was in the prime recovery area about 830 miles southwest of San Diego, Calif., ready to hoist the astronauts aboard for a series of vital medical tests to determine how well they withstood their record exposure. to space weightlessness. Earlier, Mission Control considered holding Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz in orbit longer to troubleshoot a refrigeration sroblem. But controllers decided there was nothing the astronauts could do and gave them the green light to start the homeward voyage. They had separated their Apollo ferry ship from the 118foot-long laboratory. After separation they made a 45-minute fly-around inspection of the station, televising pictures of the odd-looking space vehicle to mission control for evaluation by experts. Then inquick succession the astronauts triggered engine firings to begin their descent to earth, The first firing dropped Apollos orbit slightly below that of the Skylab station, orbiting 275 miles. high and in position to accept the Skylab 2 crew late next.month.  The second ignition dropped the astronauts into an elliptical orbit ranging from 104 miles to 29 miles high. Separation of the Apollo from the Skylab was clocked at 455 am. EDT, 10 minutes later The brief undocking delay rethan planned. sulted when the control center had trouble stabilizing gyroscopes in the house-sized space lab, Shortly before that flight controllers had commanded the craft, with the Apollo ferry ship attached o one end, to point 45 degrees down. The maneuver was necessary to warm a frozen radiator -by pointing it directly at the sun.

WASHINGTON AP -In a move apparently aimed at the sagging stock market, the Nixon administration has eased its voluntary guidelines holding dividend increases to 4 per cent a year. The Committee on Interest and Dividends Thursday gave corporations a choice of holding to the 4 per cent guideline or using a more complicated formula. The complex alternative permits dividends to rise by the average increase between 1968 to 1972.
WASHINGTON AP -In a move apparently aimed at the sagging stock market, the Nixon administration has eased its voluntary guidelines holding dividend increases to 4 per cent a year. The Commitiee on Interest and Dividends Thursday gave corporations a choice of holding to the 4 per cent guideline or using a more complicated formula. The complex alternative permits dividends to rise by the average increase between 1968 to 1972. The committees chairman, Dr. Arthur F. Burns, head of the Federal Reserve Board, said the new guidelines will make it possible for many corporations to increase their dividend payments significantly this year and to a still greater degree next year.  Benefit Elderly Burns said the move woeld be of particular benefit to the elderly and to widows dependent on dividend income. But the decision also was directed at the stock market, which has failed to respond favorably to President Nixons new 60-day freeze on prices. When a report circulated a few weeks ago that the committee was considering changing the guidelines, the stock market moved up strongly. It dropped after the administration said the proposal to ease the guidelines had been put back on the shelf. Sources said the latest move was aimed more at the stock market than anything else. The committee, an adjunct of the Cost of Living Council, said it was guided by considerations of equity, saying that the previous guidelines had limited dividend increases by some companies to unusually low levels in comparison with earnings. The move came as the Commerce Department reported that before-tax profits of corpoFations increased by 12.8 billion in the first three months of the year, putting corporate profits at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 114.3 billion.

WASHINGTON AP -The Senate Finance Committee has voted a 5.5 per cent cost-of-living increase for 28 million Social Security beneficiaries, effective next January. Indications were that both the Senate and House would accept it. The panel decided on an 11 to 2 roll call Thursday to add the provision to a debt limit extension bill, even though Nixon administration officials had objected to it. Committee Chairman Sen. Russell B. Long, D-La., said he was certain the Senate would approve the rider when it acts on the bill next week. And it was learned that House Democratic leaders were prepared to get their branch to accept it when the debt limit measure goes to conference. The House already has passed the bill. Long said the pace of inflation has been so great since the last .ocial Security boost in October 1972 that Congress has no alternative but to give some relief to these poor people who are the biggest victims of inflation. The debt limit bill was chosen as the vehicle for the rider since the President must act on it by June 30. Secretary of the Treasury George P. Shultz told the com mittee Thursday that Nixon might have to veto the measure if it contained costly riders. But Long countered that Nixon always had supported costof-living adjustments in Social Security. Present law provides for a cost-of-living adjustment but it would not take effect until January 1975.

THE HAGUE AP -The international Court of Justice called on France today to refrain from nuclear testing in the South Pacific pending a final decision on the legality of the test series. By an 8-6 vote, the court ruled that Australia and France should not take any action in the meantime which might extend the dispute or prejudice the final decision of the court. The courts ruling followed applications last month by Australia and New Zealand seeking an injunction against the French test series. The court said it would schedule further hearings in September and December. It did not say if France, which boycotted last months hearings, would be represented at the forthcoming sessions. In their pleadings before the court, representatives of both the Australian and New Zealand governments said further nuclear tests in the South Pacific would present unacceptable health and environmental dangers to the population of the areas concerned.

The courts ruling followed applications last month by Australia and New Zeland seeking an injunction against the French test series. The court said it would schedule further hearings in September and December. It did not say if France, which boycotted last months hearings, would be represented at the forthcoming sessions. In their pleadings before the court, representatives of both the Australian and New Zealand governments said further nuclear tests in the South Pacific would present unacceptable health and environmental dangers to the population of the areas concerned. The Australian attorney general, Lionel Murphy, said the forthcoming series might be of a size and yield hitherto unequalled. The people of the southern hemisphere will pay with their lives for the French decision to go ahead with their spring test program, he added. France so far has refused to give any information as to the nature and yield of the devices which it proposes to explode. The only indication so far that the tests are imminent were reports last Saturday from Tahiti saying six French navy vessels, known to be connected with the tests, eft there last week bound for the Mururoa Atoll. The Mururoa test atoll ies 750 miles southeast of Tahiti. French opposition leader Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber said in the Tahitian capital of Papeete Thursday the French government plans six or eight nuclear atmospheric tests in the South Pacific this year, and must start them by the end of July. The Radical party leader is in Tahiti to lead a mass demonstration Saturday against the tests.

They pledged in toasts of Russian champagne Thursday night to meet again in Moscow next year. Their agreement to hold a third summit conference in as many years was announced at a banquet at the Soviet Embassy where Brezhnev hosted the President, after signing pacts earlier in the day to speed nuclear arms negotiations and cooperate in research on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Today, they planned to sign still another agreement-expanding civil aviation between their nations. Before they boarded Nixons jet for a late afternoon flight to the Western White House at San Clemente, Calif., Brezhnev also was to meet with 40 American businessmen in an effort to encourage expanded trade. HOUSTON --Skylabs astronauts left their home in orbit and prepared to return to earth today to end a record 28day voyage. Charles Pete Conrad, Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz flew around Skylab for one last look before beginning their descent to a Pacific Ocean splashdown 834 miles southwest of San Diego at 950 a.m. EDT. The veteran aircraft carrier Ticonderoga, on its last mission, stood by to retrieve the astronauts and their packed command module. The Apollo was lined up for its dive into the atmosphere when Conrad fired the ships main engine at 605 a.m. WASHINGTON--Phase IV of the administrations economic program, the period that will follow the current 60day price freeze, will include strong measures to hold down food and gasoline prices. This promise was made Thursday by Chairman Herbert Stein of President Nixons Council of Economic Advisers. Stein indicated the freeze might end sooner than the 60 days. He said White House economists are assembling Phase IV so that we can announce it as soon as possible. WASHINGTON --Robert S. Strauss, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has given sworn testimony in which he termed ridiculous the notion that the Castro government in Cuba gave money to the Democratic presidential campaign. Some of the convicted conspirators, including Bernard L. Barker, have said they were looking for evidence to back up reports of such Cuban payments. Meanwhile, a furor was growing on Capitol Hill over the latest round of news leaks in the Watergate case, many of them involving testimony secretly given by former presidential counsel John W.

Everybodys in super shape, said Conrad, the veteran commander of Americas first space station. The ship reported the astronauts landed precisely on target, 843 miles southwest of San Diego. The Ticonderoga was 6 miles downwind at the time. . The aircraft carrier moyed quickly to the side of the bobbing, scorched spacecraft and hoisted it aboard, using a single nylon rope 1 inches in diameter. It was the first time an Apollo had been hoisted aboard a recovery ship with its crewmen still inside. This was done for the Skylab recovery because doctors wanted the pilots picked up with as little exertion as possible. The cone-shaped capsule was placed on an elevator deck, 25 feet above the water, at 1028 a.m., a fast 38 minutes after splashdown. Weve all got our seat belts fastened so hoist us right up, said Conrad, a Navy captain, as the line was hooked to a loop at the top of the command ship. Before leaving the Spacecraft, Kerwin, Americas first Space physician, took his own and then the pulse rate and blood pressure of his colleagues to determine how their bodies were withstanding the rigors of gravity after going without it for four weeks.

Before the Apollo hatch was opened, technicians attached plugs and fuel vent lines to the control rocket nozzles. Kerwin briefed Dr. Charles Ross, the Skylab flight surgeon, on the pilots condition before the hatch was opened. Doctors had feared that blood would rush to the pilots legs as they stood because of a temporary weakened condition of the circulatory systems resultin from the long exposure to the lac of gravity. Such blood pooling could cause a man to pass out. The Apolio was lined up for its dive into the the low point of the orbit from 262 to 104 miles. The pilots sed their television camera to beam back to mission control their parting view of the worlds largest Spaceship. This is quite a sight to all us guys on the ground that havent seen it yet, said communicator Richard Truly in Houston. Skylabs windmill-shaped solar panels stood out Clearly atop the stations big, white solar observatory section. To one side was the larger power generating wing the pilots freed 15 days ago. On top was the orange sun umbrella they raised May 26. The primary objective of the orbital marathon was to see how well men fare for long periods in weightlessness and then adjust to the stress of the deceleration into earths atmosphere and the rigors of gravity. Hinging on the medical results are plans to send two more crews up to Skylab for 56 days each. The first medical results from Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz were expected late today after doctors complete six-hour physical examinations in special, blue mobile laboratories mounted on the carriers hangar deck. In-flight tests showed the astronauts hearts had developed laziness as expected in the relative easy environment of weightlessness. Doctors planned to measure the extent of this deconditioning. Other tests were designed to measure the loss of calcium from bones, body fluid loss, blood changes and other spaceflight reactions. The pilots brought frozen blood and body waste imens with them to help medical scientists conduct the most detailed physiological tests ever conducted on returning spacemen.

Kerwin, Americas first space physician. took his own and then the pulse rate and blood pressure of his colleagues to determine how their bodies were withstanding the rigors of gravity after going without it for four weeks Before the Apollo hatch was opened. technicians attached plugs and fuel vent lines to the control rocket nozzles. Kerwin briefed Dr. Charles Ross, the Skylab flight surgeon, on the pilots condition before the hatch was opened Doctors had feared that blood would rush to the pilots legs as they stood because of a temporary weakened condition of the circulatory systems resulting from the long exposure to the lack of gravity. Such blood pooling could cause a man to pass out. The Apollo was lined up for its dive into the atmosphere when Conrad fired the ships main engine at 605 a.m. This lowered the low point of the orbit fram 262 to 104 miles. The pilots used their television camera to beam back to mission control their parting view of the worlds largest spaceship. This is quite a sight to all us guys on the ground that havent seen it yet. said communieator Richard Truly in Houston. Skylabs windmill-shaped solar panels stood out clearly atop the stations big, white solar observatory section. To one side was the larger power generating wing the pilots freed 15 days ago On top was the orange sun umbrella they rased May 26. The astronauts undocking from Skvlab occurred at 455 a.m., 10 minutes late because of brief problems with the research ships control system. That difficulty was the result of an earher maneuver designed to warm up what appeared to be a frozen space station radiator The primary objective of the orbital marathon was to see how well men fare for long periods in weightlessness and then adjust to the stress of the deceleration into earths atmosphere and the rigors of gravity. Hinging on the medical results are plans to send two more crews up to Skvlab for 56 davs each. The first medical results from Conrad. Kerwin and Weitz were expected late today after doctors complete six-hour physical examinations in special, blue mobile laboratories mounted on the carriers hangar deck. In-flight tests showed the astronauts hearts had developed laziness as expected in the relative easy environment of weightlessness. Doctors planned to measure the extent of this decon. ditioning. Other tests were designed to measure the loss of calcium from bones, body fluid loss, blood changes and other spaceflight reactions. The pilots brought frozen blood and body waste specimens with them to help medical scientists conduct the most detailed physiological tests ever conducted on returning spacemen. Their command module also was loaded with film canisters holding 30,000 of the best pictures of the sun ever taken, more than 14,000 earth resources photographs and nine miles of magnetic tape that recorded other earth sensing data.  Also removed from the eightroom space station were numerous other experiment results. a few broken parts, food samples and films showing the new way of life aboard Skylab. The next Skylab crew, meanwhile, was in Huntsville, Ala., today practicing spacewalk activities in the large water tank that Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz used to prepare for their work outside the spacecraft. Skylab 2 astronauts Alan L. Bean, Owen K. Garriott and Jack R. Lousma are scheduled to take off from Cape Kennedy July 27 and spend 56 days aboard Skylab--double the stay of their predecessors.

The only problem of the day developed just as the three Skylab 1 astronauts were preparing to leave the space station in orbit 274 miles above earth. The refrigeration system that runs the stations food andbiological sample freezers failed. The nature of the trouble was not known. and flight director Neil Hutchinson said it may be possible for ground controllers to fix it by doctoring the system by remote control from earth. If the trouble could not be fixed, Hutchinson said about 15 per cent of the food aboard Skylab could spoil. But he said this would not seriously affect the next two missions. The Apollo command ship was loaded with a wealth of information about the sun and earths natural resources as well as medical data. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA administrator, praised recovery forces for their unusually smooth pickup of the astronauts and said all major objectives of the flight were completed.

This temporary effect was expected because o the tendency of astronauts blood to pool in their legs, away from the brain, as a result of heart laziness induced by long exposure to the lack of gravity.

It meant the three Americans were in better shape after spending 28 days in space than two Russian cosmonauts were at the end of an 18-day flight in 1970. They had to be carried from their spacecraft. The primary objective of the Skylab marathon was to see how well men fare for long periods of weightlessness and then adjust to the rigors of gravity back on earth.

Weve all got our seat belts fastened so hoist us right up, said Conrad, a Navy captain, as the line was hooked to a loop at the top of the command ship. Before leaving the spacecraft, Kerwin, Americas first space physician, took his own and then the pulse rate and blood pressure of his colleagues to determine how their bodies were withstanding the rigors of ravity after going without it or four weeks. Before the Apollo hatch was -technicians attached plugs and fuel vent lines to the control rocket nozzles. Kerwin briefed Dr. Charles Ross, the Skylab flight surgeon, an the pilots condition before the hatch was opened. Doctors had feared that blood would rush to the pilots legs as they stood because of a temporary weakened condition the circulatory systems resulting from the long exposure to the lack of ypten Such blood pooling could cause a man to pass out. The Apollo was lined up for its dive into the atmosphere when Conrad fired the ships main engine at 605 a.m. is lowered the low point of the orbit from 262 to 104 miles. The pilots used their television camera to beam back to mission control their parting view of the worlds largest oreceene. This is quite a sight to all us guys on the ground that havent seen it yet, said communicator Richard Truly in Houston. Skylabs windmill-shaped solar ogg stood out clearly atop Stations big, white solar observatory section. To one side was the age oe power -age the pilots freed 5 days ago. On top was the orange . umbrella they raised May 26 The astronauts undockin from Skylab was delayed 1 minutes because of problems with the stations refrigeration system, used to run the ships food afid medical sample freezers. Flight director Neil Hutchinson said the trouble at first appeared to be caused by a frozen radiator, but it was maneuvered into sunlight with. out any effect. He said the cause of the trouble was not known, but there was nothing the astronauts could have done to fix it. Hutchinson said the worst effect the failure would have assuming it cannot be corrected radio commands from the ground, would be that about 15 per cent of the food for the next astronauts would spoil and there would be no place to store wuee and urine samples. es started looking at ssible alternatives a few urs after the Fh developed. One possibility, Hutchinson said, was to have the next astronauts carry up a small portable freezer for the medical Salmipies The primary objective of the orbital marathon was to see how well men fare for long periods in weightlessness and then adjust to the stress of the deceleration into earths atmossa and the rigor of gravity. linging on the medical results are plans to send two more crews up to Skylab for 56 days leach. The first medical results from Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz were expected late today after doctors complete six hour physical examinations in special, blue mobile laboratories mounted on the carriers hangar deck. In-flight tests showed the astronauts hearts had developed laziness as expected in the relative easy environment of weightlessness. Doctors planned to measure the extent of this deconditioning. Other tests were designed to measure the -he um Foy --, body 038, changes and other spaceflight reactions. pilots brought frozen blood and body waste speci. mens with them to help medical scientists conduct the most detailed physiological tests ever conducted on returnng. spacemen. Their command module also was loaded with film canisters holding 30,000 of the best pictures of the sun ever taken, more than 14,000 earth resources photographs and nine miles of magnetic tape that oo other earth sensing ata Also removed from the eightroom space station were numerous other experiment results, a few broken parts, food samples and films gt the new way of life aboar Skylab.

WASHINGTON UPI -President Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev pledged today to avoid military confrontations and threats of force that might lead to nuclear war between their two nations, In a policy declaration, the leaders of the two nuclear superpowers agreed to immediately enter into urgent consultations with each other should the Tisk of a nuclear conflict arise. Nixon and Brezhnev signed the agreement ---the eighth since the start of their summit talks --in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House a few hours before their scheduled departure aboard the presidential jetliner for San Clemente, Calif., for the conclusion of their week-long conference. . In the agreement, the two leaders promised that the United States and the Soviet Union will act in such a manner as to prevent the development of situations capable of causing a dangerous exacerbation of their relations, as to avoid military confrontations, and to exclude the outbreak of nuclear war between them and between either of the parties and other countries, The accord also calls for the signatories to proceed from the premise that each will refrain from the threat or use of force against the other party,against the allies of the cther party, and against other countries, in circumstances which may endanger international peace and security, In advance of the signing, Nixon briefed congressional leaders of both parties on the declaration, which is a statement of policy --not a treaty -and therefore does not require Senate ratification. Presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger said the intent of the doctrine was to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war.

Their promises to meet again in Moscow next year were accompanied by champagne toasts. The jovial atmosphere reflected the signing earlier in the day of pacts intended to accelerate negotiations to limit and reduce offensive nuclear weapons and exchange research on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Todays promises to refrain from military confrontations went into effect immediately upon signing of the policy declaration about 1230 p.m. EDT. In the agreement, the two leaders promised that the United States and the Soviet Union will act in such a manner as to prevent the development of situations capable of causing a dangerous exacerbation of their relations, as to avoid military confrontations, and to exclude the outbreak of nuclear wars between them and between either of the parties and other countries.

In advance of the signing, Nixon briefed congressional leaders of both parties on the declaration, which is a statement of policy --not a treaty -and therefore does not require Senate ratification. Presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger said the intent of the doctrine was to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war. Kissinger said steps toward the agreement began at the end of the Moscow summit meeting between Nixon and Brezhnev in May, 1972. Kissinger said the accord can be a significant landmark in relations between the two great nuclear powers. The accord, effective immediately, is of unlimited duration and both parties said nothing in it would affect or impair the right of individual or collective self-defense under the U.N. Charter or separate treaty obligations, such as those the United States has as a member of NATO. Kissinger said the declaration is a formal obligation on the part of the United States and the Soviet Union to practice restraint in diplomacy and to build a peace that is permanent. Asked how the agreement might relate to current American bombing in Cambodia, Kissinger said only that such military operations were in progress when the agreement was negotiated. But he conceded the use of force in such circumstances could threaten the letter and spirit of this agreement. Kissinger said United States had consulted with several allies before concluding the accord. The signing of the agreement was the major action of the morning for the two leaders. Brezhnev will be a guest at Nixons home in San Clemente, La Casa Pacifica, from this evening until Sunday morning when he flies back to Washington

WASHINGION AP -Fresident Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev have reached agreement on a broadly-worded declaration vowing to avoid nuclear war and plan to sign the summit document later today, sources said. The White House said that a midday signing ceremony would be held in the East Room. But spokesmen refused to disclose what would be signed. Other sources reported, however, that the document was a declaration of intent to reduce the risk of nuclear devastation. The agreement was reached as the two leaders looked ahead to a reunion summit in Moscow in 1974--the target date for formally limiting the awesome atomic arsenals of the, two countries. Although the surprise compact was cloaked in unusual secrecy, Nixon himself made a reference to the signing ceremony Thursday nirht. Tll see you at 1230 tomorrow at the signing, Nixon reminded Brezhnev just before midnight as he left the Soviet Embassy after a banquet of caviar, borsch, Russian beef and fish, two kinds of vodka and Soviet champagne. The two leaders announced at the banquet plans for their third summit. White House sources confirmed the document signing intentions but refused Thursday night to give details, saying only, Its going to be an important one. Prior to the White House ceremony, Brezhnev arranged to meet with about 40 business leaders at Blair House to discuss U.S.-Soviet trade--one of the items of unfinished business he cited Thursday night. The two leaders popped a surprise in their banquet toasts, disclosing that Brezhnev. had extended and Nixon had accepted an invitation to return to the Soviet Union next year for a third summit in as many years. The reunion could provide a forum for the signing of a treaty placing permanent limits, and possibly calling for reductions, of the two nations offensive nuclear weapons. Nixon and Brezhnev, in a declaration of principles signed at the White House Thursday, the fourth day of their summit talks, set a 1974 target date for completing the lasting limitations on the number and quality of strategic nuclear weapons. The seven-point accord is intended to accelerate stalemated Strategic Arms  Limitation Talks SALT in Geneva. The U.S.-Soviet negotiators are trying to work out a permanent treaty to replace an interim arms limitation agreement signed at the Moscow summit a year ago. The document signed Thursday leaves open the possibility of a partial, temporary agreement before 1974. Such an accord could be signed in Moscow next year if the broader, permanent agreement is not completed prior to the reunion summit. Later today, Nixon and Brezhnev were scheduled to fly to the Presidents San Clemente, Calif., home, traveling together aboard Nixons Spirit of 76 jetliner. They will conclude their summit there on Simdayv

Its approval by the House would put a quick test to Nixons post-Watergate mood of accommodation with Congress, signaled this week when he signed three bills he had originally opposed. On Nixons behalf Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz opposed the Social Security boost Thursday as unnecessary in light of last years tremendous 20 per cent increase, but the Senate Finance Committee brushed away his objections and voted 12 to 2 to raise payments. Republicans Wallace F. Bennett, Utah, and Paul J. Fannin, Ariz., voted no. Also winning committee approval were a liberalization of welfare payments to aged, blind or disabled adults a delay in a cutback of social services to the poor a 268.7 ceiling on federal expenditures in fiscal 1974, as Nixon proposed.

It must be extended to enable the government to continue borrowing and normal operations. Congress plans to recess at the end of next week for a nine-day Independence Day holiday. So a decision by Nixon-hinted at by Shultz--to veto the bill could cause Nixon to call Congress back ito Committee Chairman Russell B.

The increase would add 2.75 billion to the 52 billion annual flow of checks to retired and disabled workers and their dependents and survivors. In all, one American in seven receives Social Security. Long said the unanticipated pace of inflation made the increase necessary. To finance inflation by taking it out of the would be the cruelest thing you could do, he said.

WASHINGTON UPI -Phase IV of the administrations economic program, the period that will follow the current 60-day price freeze, will include strong measures to hold down food and gasoline prices. This promise was made Thursday by Chairman Herbert Stein of President Nixons Council of Economic Advisers. Stein also hinted the freeze might be lifted before its scheduled expiration in mid-August. Nixon imposed the freeze last week, saying his administration would use the 60-day -to put together the Phase IV program. Stein amplified administration policy in a 12-page statement titled The Freeze and After issued Thursday. Whatever the mechanism may be, Phase IV is obviously oing to contain strong measures or holding down the rise of food prices, the economist wrote. The President has given a similar directive for gasoline prices at the pump. Phase IV Goal Stein said the goal of Phase IV would be to slow inflation to a rate at which the American people no longer regard inflation as the No. 1 national problem. A monthly Labor Department report issued Thursday said the cost of living went up 0.6 per cent in May. This compared to an 0.7 per cent rise in February, an 0.9 per cent increase in March and an 0.7 per cent gain in April. Meat prices went down 0.1 per cent last month, the report said, the first decline since December. Meat prices have climbed 13.2 per cent since the first of the year. There were complaints about the administrations handling of the situation Thursday from the Senate Agriculture Committee and two food-producing groups. The Agriculture Committee said in a statement the freeze program could prove disastrous by producing shortages of food. The members called on Nixon to remove raw  food products from the freeze at once and place them under a Phase IV plan which hopefully will be better adapted to the special needs and problems. of agricultural production. Below-Cost Situation Cited At the same time, the National Fishers Institute said some of its members expect soon to start curtailing production of frozen fish portions and fish sticks because of a pinch caused by the price freeze. And spokesmen for egg producers told the Cost of Living Council in a statement that the freeze had locked shell e producers into a below-cost-ofproduction situation. The United Egg Producers organization said consumer supplies would be drastically reduced unless something is done. Stein indicated the freeze might end sooner than the 60 days.

The 7-1 decision, written by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., came in a Denver, Colo. case. Deputy District Attorney Michael R. Capizzi of Orange County, Calif., a jurisdiction involved in one of the series of cases ruled on by the court, said the court has taken some of the uncertainty out of the pornography area by adopting a more practical approach as to how obscenity may be determined. David Schachter of the Los Angeles City Attorneys office noted that prosecutions all over the country should now be easier because many of the defenses formerly available to the accused have been eliminated.

WASHINGTON AP -In an attack on hard-core pornography, the Supreme Court Thursday wrote stringent new guidelines on the limits of sexual candor in books and movies. Combating the trend toward greater sexual explicitness, the 5-4 decision gave local prosecutors a broader definition of what is obscene and therefore outside the protection of the First Amendment. The high court abandoned its long-held test that to be obscene, sexual material must, among other things, be utterly without redeeming social value. And, the court ruled, local community standards on permissible candor should govern--not a national standard.  Critics of such an approach have claimed that it would reduce movie distributors and publishers to offering works that met the standard of the most prudish community in the nation. For the first time since the court first grappled with the issue in 1957, a majority of this court has agreed on concrete guidelines  isolate hard-core pornogra proclaimed Chief Justice Warren E. Burger who wrote the majority opinion in five related obscenity cases. The majority opinion prompted dissenting Justice William J. Brennan Jr. to declare that it is now hard to see how state-ordered regimentation of our minds can ever be forestalled. In other action, the court ursday eG  Held in a case from Denver that system-wide desegregation is uired when school officials have caused racial separation in a substantial portion of the schools.

WASHINGTON AP -In an attack on hard-core pornography, the Supreme Court Thursday wrote stringent new guidelines on the limits of sexual candor in books and movies. Combating the trend toward greater sexual explicitness, the 5-4 decision gave local prosecutors a broader definition of what is obscene and therefore outside the protection of the First Amendment. The high court abandoned its long-held test that to be obscene, sexual material must, among other things, be utterly without redeeming social value. And, the court ruled, local community standards on permissible candor should govern-not a national standard. Critics of such an approach have claimed that it would reduce movie distributors and publishers to offering works that met the standard of the most prudish community in the nation. For the first time since the court first grappled with the issue in 1957, a majority of this court has agreed on concrete guidelines to isolate hard-core pornography, proclaimed Chief Justice Warren E. Burger who wrote the majority opinion in five related obscenity cases. The majority opinion prompted dissenting Justice William J. Brennan Jr. to declare that it is now hard to see how state-ordered regimentation of our minds can ever be forestalled. In other action, the court Thursday --Held in a case from Denver that system-wide desegregation is required when school officials have caused racial separation in a substantial portion of the schools. The case hinged on the actions of school officials, since Colorado has never had a law requiring segregation. --Held that the First Amendment does not prohibit cities from outlawing sex segregation in newspaper help-wanted ads. --Ruled that criminal defendants are not entitled to have a lawyer present when their pictures are shown to prospective witnesses.

In a companion case from Georgia, the court held that there is no constitutional requirement for the testimony of experts on whether material is obscene. The case involved the showing of two films at the Paris Adult Theater in Atlanta. Burger said the films were the best evidence of what they represented. In the Georgia case, the court emphatically rejected the notion that such films had constitutional protection when shown only to consenting adults. Burger said the state has 7. legitimate interest in stemming the tide of commercialized obscenity Brennan, joined by Potter Stewart and Thurgood Marshall, dissented sharply, concentrating his objection on Burgers opinion in the Georgia case It the states are permitted,  in an effort to maintain or create a particular moral tone, to prescribe what its citizens cannot read or cannot see, then it would seem to follow that in pursuit of that same objective a state could decree that its citizens must read certain books or must view certain films, wrote Brennan. In a separate dissent, Justice William O. Douglas suid he has never been trapped into seeing or reading something that would offend me.  see no constitutional basis for fashioning a rule that makes a publisher, producer, bookseller, librarian or movie house criminally responsible, when he or she fails to take affirmative steps to protect the consumer against literature or books ottensive to those who temporarily occupy the seats of the mighty, Douglas wrote. In the other obscenity decisions, the high court approved the authority of Congress to prohibit the transportation of obscene material on common carriers such as airlines and trucks, and to prohibit its importation whether for private or commercial use. tena a. ee preowny -lee 7 ae wn -

PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico AP -A Mexican airliner with 12 Americans aboard crashed in Mexico, and a rescue flier said Thursday that all 27 persons aboard were killed. The Aeromexico DC9 flight, originating in Houston, Tex., carried 23 passengers and a crew of four when it crashed after stopping in Monterrey, the airline said. The plane, flight 229 had a final destination of Mexico City. It crashed about 1130 p.m. CDT Wednesday in a jungled, mountainous area about 14 miles from Puerto Vallarta airport. It was making what appeared to be a normal landing approach, authorities said. All of the Americans had boarded the plane in Houston. Ten were going to Puerto Vallarta and one was going to Mexico City, Mexican immigration autorities said. Miguel Chacon, a helicopter pilot who landed at the crash site, said all the bodies were removed and there were no survivors. He said large portions of the plane were intact. Rescuers had to hack through the jungle to reach the crash site, near the Pacific coast. The bodies were carried through the jungle to trucks, which removed them to the beach where they were taken to Puerto Vallarta by boats. Witnesses said the plane appeared to explode or spurt flame as it made its final approach to the Puerto Vallarta Airport. All had been normal on the approach, the air traffic controller reported, until suddenly the plane lost radio contact and flamed after Capt. Carlos Fernandez de Lara tested his landing lights. The last radio contact was at 1123 p.m. when Fernandez de Lara confirmed approval to descend from 14,000 to 4,000 feet while over the Pacific Ocean. We saw a red light flash at low altitude over the sea, said Luis R. Rosales who was watching the moon from his front porch with his family. It was a bright light in the sky. We didnt hear anything, but we saw this bright flash.

WASHINGTON AP--The Sharpest iinflation rate in 22 years continued its rapid pace in May as the buying power of American workers fell again,  government reported Thursay. The Labor Department said higher prices for food, clotheing and gasoline pushed the cost of living up six-tenths of 1 per cent a rate slightly less than the seven-tenths of 1 per cent recorded in April. This works out to an annual rate of 7.2 per cent, down from the 8.4 per cent annual rate of increase projected in April. President Nixons chief economics adviser Herbert Stein, said the figures show inflation subsiding from its earlier peak but still much too high and subsiding too slowly. The bureau of Labor Statistics said after-tax take-home pay of rank-and file workers veraged 125.12 in May, up 87, cents from April and 14.51 from a year ago. But it calculated that inflation reduced real spendable earnings of those workers four-tenths of 1 per cent in May--the fifth decline in the past seven months. Nixons 60-day price freeze announced earlier this month is not expected to be reflected in price reports until midsummer.  However, the May figures reflect the full impact of the ceiling imposed on meat prices March 29. From April to May, meat prices declined one-tenth of 1 per cent following huge jumps earlier this year. Mays Consumer Price Index for all items climbed from 140.7 to 13. 15 and was 5.5 per cent above a year ago. for shoppers, this meant it cost 13.15 last month to buy variety of goods and services that would have cost 10 in 1967. Food again was a major culprit in inflationary spiral, rising 1.1 per cent on a seasonal basis. But the increase was the smallest so far this year. compared with jumps of 1.4 per cent in April and 2.4 per cent im March. Prices rose sharply for cerea -and bakery products, most dairy items, fish, coffee anc fresh vegetables. Egg prices declined, but at a rate less thar usual in May. Prices of products other that food increased four-tenths of -per cent seasonally adjuster and six-tenths of 1 per cen unadjusted in May. Services including rent. rose four-tenth of 1 per cent, following rises o three-tenths of 1 per cent i each of the previous tw months. Gasoline prices rose sharpl for the second straight month climbing 1.2 per cent in May t a level 8.1 per cent above  year ago. The cost of eating i restaurants rose 1.4 per cent biggest increase since 1953. The total Consumer Price In dex, including food, other good and services increased at ai annual rate of 8.7 per cent dur ing the past three months o Phase 3 controls.

Detroit, May 10--LP--The Ford strike idling 65.000 men -and threatening as many more -was carried to the peace table today. On the aixth day of the speedup deadlock, management and the ClO-United Auto Workers sought a solution together. Their initial negotiations were set for 2 gelock 1 p. m cst. In keeping with other events of this first major labor battle in  year in the auto industry, the agreement to negotiate came yes terday with dramatic suddenness. Young President Henry Ford IL, acting swiftly, accepted a proposal for talks from President Waller Reuther of the union. , The two acted ag strike-caused Hayofts in Ford and supplier firms already were mounting into the thousands. A full 20,000 more Ford workers ace idleness within a week if the istrike is not settled. Ford has warned it may have to shut down all its 49 plants. Im agreeing to negotiations Ford said his company assumed that the Htalka would be continued until this gtrike can be, brought to a close. i Declires To Debate He declined two accompanying iproposals from Reuther, however. Ford said he would neither appear personally at the negotiations jmor would he engage in ao public jdebate with Reuther if the dispute i werent settled by Friday. The red-haired union chief, in  public statement ater, deplored Fords answer on these two counts, but he carried the matter no further. It was only a little more than ltwo hours after receiving Reuithers invitation to negotiate that Ford returned his formal assent. Almost immediately the initial seasion was arranged--in the same Detroit building where the futile peace talks of last Thursday collapeed shortly after the strike deadline last Thursday. Declining Reuthers proposal for a debate, Ford said nothing useful could be accomplished.

Detroit, May 10--AP--The Ford strike idling 65,000 men--and threatening as many more--was carried to the peace table today.  On the sixth day of the speed-up deadlock, manage--ment and the CIO United Auto Workers sought a solution together. Their initial negotiations were set for 1 p. m. In keeping with other events of this first major labor battle in a year in the auto industry, the agreement to negotiate came yesterday with dramatic suddenness. Young president Henry Ford H, acting swiftly, accepted a proposal for talks from President Walter Reuther of the union.

Ford has warned it may have to shut down all its 49 plants. In agreeing to negotiations Ford said his company assumed that the talks would be continued until the strike can be brought to a close. Declines Two Proposals He declined two accompanying proposals from Reuther, however. Ford said he would neither appear personally at the negotiations nor would he engage in a public debate with Reuther if the dispute werent settled by Friday. The red-haired union chief, in a public statement later, deplored Fords answer on those two counts, but he carried the matter no further. It was only a little more than two hours after receiving Reuthers invitation to negotiate that Ford returned his formal assent. Almost immediately the initial session was arranged-in the same Detroit building where the futile peace talks of last Thursday collapsed shortly after the strike deadline last Thursday. Declining Reuthers proposal for a debate, Ford said nothing useful could be accomplished. The union president had suggested that he and Ford meet on a rostrum in Briggs stadium, home of the Detroit Tigers baseball team, before a mass meeting of Ford workers. No Emotional Appeal The issues, Ford said, must be resolved on their merits and by conscientious effort at the bargain ing table by both parties, and not by emotional appeal. Reuther asked Fords personal presence at the negotiations so that he would be apprized of all the facts in the situation which you obviously do not have. However, Ford said he was leaving the negotiations to John 8. Bugas, vice president in charge of industrial relations who headed the company team in the previous talks. As Ford negotiations gave rise to hopes for peace on that dispute, there was other trouble in the  industry.

The new Jewish nation won the big test vote by a three-to-one -maiority late Monday. The general assemblys special 58-nation political committee endorsed the Israeli bid by 33-11. Thirteen countries abstained and one was ab sent.  If the full assembly follows the lead of its committee then the year-old eastern Mediterranean nation will become the 59th member of the world organization. The final assembly decision, requiring a two-thirds majority of the members voting is expected Wednesday or Thursday. The test vote came on a joint resolution sponsored by the United States, Australia, Canada, Guatemala, Haiti, Panama and Uruguay. Among those voting for the proposal were The entire Soviet bloc of six countries and Argentina, China, Cuba, Norway. New Zealand, Mexico and the Netherlands. Afghanistan, Burma, India, Iran and Pakistan joined with the Arabs in opposing Israels admission. Among those abstaining were Britain, France, Belgium, Sweden, Greece, Turkey and Denmark. Only a sudden reversal by several nations can keep Israel out of the U.N. The final committee vote came as a surprise since 19 countries voted a few minutes earlier in favor of a Lebanese plan to defer action on the Israeli bid until fall.  The same committee moves on to consideration of a new resolution in the Indonesian case Tuesday. Australia and India, original sponsors of a move to have the assembly deal with the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, proposed the question be deferred until the assemblvs fall session. The two countries acted in view of a reported agreement in Batavia druing the past several days between Dutch and Indonesian representatives. Possible committee action on the new proposal was blocked late Monday when Poland and Russia insisted on additional time for studying the Indian-Australian recommendation. ,

The Democrats have nominated Judge Benjamin Shalleck, a distinguished lawyer and judge who most nearly is representative of the people of the district. The Communists have presented us with Dr. Annette Rubinstein, who is fighting Stalins battles on upper Broadway. Young Roosevelt wanted the Democratic nomination. He worked to get it. He tried to force himself on the Democratic party. They turned him down for the good reason that he does not belong he is an outsider and represents nothing but his fathers name, which may or may not be a political asset depending on how the wind blows around May 17, when the election is to be held, Franklin Roosevelt, Jr. never lived in this district. There is no reason why he should know the people of it or their problems. He is neither by ancestry, mirth, education, interests nor habits a part of them. His only excuse for wanting to represent them is that he wants to. He apparently dares not run in his own district, which is on the other side of town where the rich live. We are essentially a middle-class district, mostly of Jewish and Irish ancestry. Sol Bloom fitted this district perfectly so would either Judge Shalleck or Mr. McIntyre. When Roosevelt could not get the Democratic nomination, he took one from David Dubinskys Liberal party. While most of the inhabitants of this district respect David Dubinsky, they think of him as a labor leader, not as a politician handing out nominations. Besides, Dubinsky does not live in our district any more than Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. does. It seems to many that we should be permitted to manage our own affairs, to have as our representative in Congress, a neighbor, one of our own kind, who knows what our special problems are and will act accordingly. That is the business of a representative, as intended by the Constitution, and we understand it. So, when Junior decided to run for Congress and picked us, he took a room in the Esplanade hotel, which is right opposite the tenement in which I live. I have not asked the elevator boys how often he has been there because I am not a snooper, but this hotel is not his normal habitat. Without any reflection on the hotel or its guests or on my block or my neighbors, cannot imagine his picking this particular part of town to live in. Neither his father, his mother or any of his brothers ever did and Junior never did until he decided that Congress needs a Roosevelt and he picked himself Personally, 1 shall not vote for him. He does not belong here. I am puzzled whether many who would ordinarily vote for Mr. MeIntyre will not, in this election, vote for Judge Shalleck to make sure that Junior does not slip in. But of this I am certain I shall not vote for an interloper like Junior who suddenly becomes a friend of my people up here and tries to talk like one of us, which he isnt A representative in Congress should be of the people of the district he should be of the warp and woof of that district, not somebody who takes a room in a -a few weeks before election ay.

McCauley explained to reporters after the first hearing that no specific crime must be proved by the prosecution at such a hearing, but that the court must be satisfied that a crime -any crime -has been committed. After that, he said, t is up to the district attorney to determine under what charge the defendant will be prosecuted. And in this case, gentlemen, he added, it will be first degree murder.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. -A few years ago, if anyone predicted that white and Negro teachers would soon be paid the same salaries in the schools of Alabama, he would have been scoffed at. A few years ago also, no one would have believed the prediction that Negro schools would become as up-to-date and modern as white schools. And if anyone had predicted that a Negro would sit among twelve good men and true on a jury which decided the fate of a white man where the death sentence was involved, he would have been considered revolutionary. However, all of these things have happened--in Alabama. Purthermore, there seems to be a healthy desire in this stote, which has one of the heaviest Negro populations of tne bou..u, . work quietly and steadily toward improvement of race relations. Two new Negro high schools have just been finished in Montgomery, and this writer, who recently visited them, can testify to the fact that they appear more up-to-date than the older schools for white children. Alabamans admit that the Negro schools were long overdue, and that it has only been recently that Negro education has begun to catch up. However, the important thing is that it has improved. Montgomery also boasts a state teachers college for Negroes which has a large number of modern, new, well-equipped buildings, plus an athletic field which some Alabamans ruefully claim is better than theirs. Montgomerys most beautiful monument to Negro education, however, is St. Judes school, built by the nickles and pennies scraped together by a Catholic priest, Father Purcell. It probably surpasses anything built by the state.  NORTH-SOUTH COOPERATION Another monument to NorthSouth cooperation is being urged by the Blue and Gray association which has built part of a football stadium for athletie contests between the North and the South. and is now trying to raise sufficient funds to complete the project. Eventually a monument to the two great generals of the Civil War--Lee and Grant--will stand outside this shrine to North-South friendship, where already an annual football game is played between two all-star teams from the North and South in Montgomery, the cradle of the Confederacy. Taking a cue from the Blue and Gray association, many Southern high schools invited Northern school elevens to the South last winter, and the idea is spreading. You cant cant legislate or force goodwill and brotherly love, says Champ Pickens, chief organizer of the Blue and Gray Memorial. You have to encourage it. The Blue and Gray has done a lot of encouraging and will do more down here in the heart of the deep South--if given a little help from those in the North who sometimes criticize without taking the trouble to find out how much progress the South is making on its own. WALLACEITE SURPRISES GOP The Young Republicans club of New York staged a banquet in Manhattan the other night to announce the winner of an essay contest. It was a distinguished and important occasion. Some of the top leaders of the Republican party, including Harold Stassen, had judged the contest and another judge, Bruce Bromiey, of the New York Court of Appeals, was present to announce the winner. Judge Bromley made the announcement with much dignity.

CHENNAULT ON CHINA Newspapermen were shooed out of the Senate Armed Services committee the other day in order to find out if Gen. Claire Chennault had anything confidential to say about China. He didnt. In answer to a question from Chairman Millard Tydings o Maryland, however, Chennault estimated it would cost one million dollars a day to support the nine Chinese provinces still holding out against the Communists. As for graft in China, Chennhault snapped Corruption isnt confined to China. It is found in France--and even in the United States. The Flying Tiger chief also urged that U. 8. volunteers be allowed to help train Nationalist soldiers and plan their battle Strategy. He warned hat the Communists have a genius for organizing and will be able to hold China once they conquer it.

She must not think about it so imuch, she told herself. Soon it would begin to show like an iliness one could rot conceal until death. A cascade of emotions weakened her. ts all linked, she thought wretchedly. The mind, the spirit, the body. When one was damaged, the others were also maimed, their functions crippled. I want to cry, she thought. Ive been wanting to cry for a long time. Thats why my tears are so near the surface. But there is no place where I can go where no one will see me. Why didnt I cry with David that day in the park What is David, and what is he to me To hide my face above his heart and cry, feeling his compassion warming, reassuring. Oh, David... Weve had a swell time, Frank Sanger was saying. We always do, Bee. Beatrice does things so beautifully, and with such case, Porters mother said. Thank you, Beatrice replied. You say that, she thought, while I feel like a feather in the wind. Where is the rich contentment once knew A gift of the gods, like so many of those gifts I didnt realize until I lost them. Where is the bright promise of somarrow The ripe, golden riddle years that some people dread, and which Ive anticipated with Porter The wish, the only wish tn the center of my existence, has been that Porter and I should love cach other throughout our lives. The car was climbing a hill When it reached the top, Beatrice said, Below the hill at the left 1s the Ramey plant. Smoke spiraled from the low flat buildings, many of whicn had been erected in haste after the declaration of war. Beatrices brows furrowed when it occurred to her for the first tirne that the ray buildings behind the high wire fence bore a close resemblance to pictures she had seen of a penal colony. The guard walking to and fro over the dirty snow added reality, though the man wags probably just trying to keep warm. Krank Sanger chuckled like a child about to do a daring and forbidden thing. Do you suppose theyll let us in Katharine Sanger said, Places like this are so colorless, go grim. Youll have to go in, Beatrice, but Cll wait in the car if you dont mind. Jts warm and I have the robe. Her laughter carne in little light ripples. No wonder Porter has loved coming home to all the beauty you have made for him, Beatrice, after this atl day. Prank Sanger patted his wifes gloved hand. Thank you for indulging me, dear. Are you sire youll be comfortable while Im inside Of course. like Beatrices car. One of the suppressed desires of niy youth was to have a car like this, Beatrice went into the building, Porters stepfather following.

MONTGOMERY, Ala--A few vears ago, if anyone predicted that white and negro teachers would soon be paid the same salaries in the schools of Alabama, he would have been scoffed at.

MONTGOMERY, Ala., -A few years ago, if anyone predicted that white and Negro teachers would soon be paid the same salaries in the schools of Alabama, he would have been scoffed at. A few years ago, nc one would have believed, the preciction that Nego schools would become as up-to-date and modern as white schools. And if anyone had predicted that a Negro would sit among twelve good men and true on a jury which decided the fate of a white man where the death sentence was involved, he would have been considered revolutionary. However, all of these things have happened -in Alabama. Furthermore, there seems to be a healthy desire in this  state which has on of the heaviest Negro populations of the south, to work quietly and steadily toward improvement of race relations. Two new Negro high schools have just been finished in Montgomery, and this writer, who recently visited them, can testify to the fact that they appear more upto-date than the older schools for white children.

Montgomery also boasts a state Teachers college for Negroes which has a large number of modern, new, well-equipped buildings, plus an athletic field which some Alabamans ruefully claim is better than theirs.

It probably surpasses anything built by the state. NORTH-SOUTH COOPERATION Another monument to north-south cooperation is being urged by the Blue and Gray association which has built part of a football stadium for athletic contests between the north and the south, and is now trying to raise sufficient funds to complete tthe project. Eventually a monument to the two great generals of the Civil War--Lee and Grant --will stand outside this shrine to northsouth friendship where already an annual football game is played between two allstar teams from the north and the south in Montgomery, the cradle of the Confederacy. Taking a cue from the Blue and Gray association, many southern high schools invited northern school elevens to the south last winter, and the idea is spreading. You cant legislate or force goodwill and brotherly love, says Champ Pickens, chief organizer of the Blue and Gray memorial. You have to encourage it. The Blue and Gray has done a lot of encouraging and will do more down here in the heart of the deep south--if given a little help from those in the north who sometimes criticize without taking the trouble to find out how much progress the south is making on its own. WALLACEITE SURPRISES G. O. P. The Young Republicans club of New York staged a banquet in Manhattan the other night to announce the winner of an essay contest. It was a distinguished and important occasion. Some of the top leaders of the Republican party, including Harold Stassen, had judged the contest and another judge, Bruce Bromley, of the New York court of appeals, was present to announce the  winner. Judge Bromley made the announcement with much dignity. He spoke of the importance of young political leaders rising to the front, and the importance of the question on which the essays were written--Should the senate rules be changed He also emphasized that the contest had been nonpartisan, following which he announced the winner, H. Car Markel, a promising young man from Williams college, one of the old and blue-blooded colleges of New England. Young Markel rose, calmly pocketed the 100 prize, and said This is indeed a nonpartisan contest. In fact it isnt even bipartisan, but tripartisan. For during the last election I campaigned for Henry Wallace. Dignified Judge Bromley looked horrified. Some of the Republicans acted as if a bombshell had struck. And I would like to tell you why I worked for Wallace, continued young Markel. Whereupon Republican leaders were forced to sit in silence and listen to a political pep talk by one of Wallaces ardent admirers, Note--After Markel finished, Sen. Wayne Morse of Oregon, the main speaker of the evening, made this comment on Markels essay If you had asked me, I could have told you that the Wallaceites dont want to change the senate rules, because they can spread more confusion under the present archaic rules. CHENNAULT ON CHINA Newspapermen were shooed out of the senate armed services committee the other day in order to find out if Gen. Claire Chennault had anything confidential to say about China. He didnt. In answer to a question from Chairman Millard Tydings of Maryland, however, Chennault estimated it would cost one million dollars a day to support the nine Chinese provinces still holding out against the Communists. At for graft in China, Chennault snapped Corruption isnt confined to China. It is ,found in France--and even in the United States. The Flying Tiger chief also urged that U.

All of which could take ccasiderable time. This doesnt make for dramatic reading. but the two men who should know claim the reorganization bill is one of the most important before the Blst Congress. They are the only two living men. who have been US president Mr. Truman and former President Herbert Hoover. Hoover headed a commission tha looked into every phase of the governments executive operations His report said, in effect, that nec longer can the US Government get by by cleaning an occasional sparkplug or putting on a new water pump. No, said Hoover, what is needed is a complete overhaul job. Mr. Truman agrees. And in his --message to the House and Senate Monday he said of the Hoovers Commission work While there will be honest differences of opinion concerning many of the commissions specific recommendations, I believe that the commissions work as a whole represents a landmark in the field of government organization.  The highest commendation is due the membership of the commission.

Washington, May 9 P--President Trumans economic advisers have suggested that some existing tax burdens be lightened and that the administration scale down its request for 4,000,000,000 in new levies, responsible officials said today. The council of. Economic Advisers also was reported to feel. that current business trends justify a eheck rein on federal spending in order to bring the budget closer to balance. d Such levies.as the tax on-.transportation of goods, in the councils opinion, add to business cosis. and consumer prices and impede an orderly withdrawal trom the postwar business boom. The advisers suggested that consideration be given to accepting a lesser goal than the 4,000,000,000 tax increase. Mr. Truman has Suggested that, this money be raised mostly from corporations and, perhaps, from middie and upper in-. dividual income brackets. The council did not recommend at this time the launching of. an expanded publle works program, an authoritative source disclosed. The advisers have consistently urged that federal and local governments prepare shelves of public work biueprints for, use when needed to holster employment and public purchasing power. But the present trend of the economy--which council. chairman Hawin G. Nourse calls a healthly disinflation--does not warrant large-scale works spending now, the council feels. Such outlays would make it harder to reach the goal of lower government costs. The three-member council--Dr. Nourse, vice chairman Leon Kyserling, and Dr. John D. Clark--were reported to be in substantial agreement on the April sizeup of the economy. While there may have been some conilict of views, it was indicated, there was no such outright split as occurred early in fhe year when Kyserling and Clark outvoted Nourse in advocating the passage of stand-by anti-inflation controls, After a White House visit last. Thesday, Nourse informed news men that the council expects some further easing of living costs. He. said prices are continuing down ward but not on a demoralizing basis and that there is no need to dig into the storm cellars.

WASHINGTON. AP. President Trumans economic advisers have suggested that some existing tax burdens be lightened and that the administration scale down its request for 4,000,000,000 in new levies, responsible officials SSP ES UN PENNS CRONE GENEL LATE 6GELAEE ES quest for 4,000,000,000 in ne said Monday night. The council of economic advisers also was reported to fee that current business trends justify a check rein on federal spending in order to bring the budget closer to balance The council delivered its April report to the white house last week. It suggested the lowering or removal of some excise taxes, it was learned.   SUCH LEVIES as the tax on transportation of goods, in the councils opinion, add to prices and impede an orderly withdrawal from the postwar business hoom. The acivisers suggested that consideration be given to accepting a lesser goal than the 4,000,000,000 tax increase. Mr. Truman has suggested that this money be raised mostly from corporations. The council did not recommend at this time the launching of an expanded public works program, an authoritative source disclosed. The advisers have consistently urged that federal and local governments prepare shelves of public work blueprints for use when needed to bolster employment and public purchasing power.  + .7 THE THREE-MEMBER council--Chairman Edwin C. Nourse, Vice Chairman Leon Kyserling, and Dr. John D. Clark-----were reported to be in substantial agreement on the April size-up of the economy. The council reportedly suggested that study be given these tax policies . 1. Reducing those wartime excise taxes which basically affect business operations and which produce only a comparatively small amount of revenue. The 3 percent levy on air, land and  water freight, for instance, pyramids costs because it applies anew at each step from mine or mill to consumer, 2. Delaying the date of the proposed increases in the social  security payroll tax from July 1 S proposed by administration leaders--to the presently sche-duled date, next Jan. 1. 3. Accepting a lesser goal than the 4,000,000,000 tax inerease which Mr. Truman askec iin January. Some officials hole that such a tax boost now migh eat up private capital needed fo industrial expansion, or cause business to retrench so severel jthat the healthy disinflation might skid into a serious reces sion. Mr. Trumans budget report ih January predicted a deficit o 600,000,000 for fiscal 1949, end. jing next June 30. It foresaw  deficit of 873,000,000 in fisca 1950.

He did not identify any atomic scienlisis recruited by the party, or give the exact locations where the se. cret party meetings were held. QUIT IN DISGUST The 47-year-old Crouch renounced communism in 1942 in disgust at it methods. He had worked for the party for 17 years and had been named an honorary officer in the Red Army. Crouch, who is now employed ir the mechanical department of the Miami, Fla.

The kaiser was an autocrat who believed that he ruled by devine right, a fact which inspired an American to write the famous satirical poem Me Und Gott, which infuriated the emperor. The old kaiser was the epitome of prussianism. Under his Me Und Gott rule, aiming at expansion, there was a rapid rise in taxation because of the cost of armament, and a large class of the population was dissatisfied with the militaristic organization of the country. It was this period that saw the great expansion uf tie Krupp armament works in the Ruhr. Then came the world war which resulted in the abdication of the kaiser. The Weimar republic tried to inaugurate democracy, only toa be overtaken by the Hitlerian regime, which represented one of the most terrible dictatorships of all time. Now we get the violent revulsion to all this in the new constitution. German political leaders claim it is the most progressive in existence. Well, they are going to have their chance to prove that claim. They still will be under Allied supervision until such time as they have demonstrated their fitness to walk alone, but the Allied purpose is to encourage them to stand on their own feet. The constitution, of course, can only apply to the three zones of Western Germany at the outset, but it has been drawn up SO as to include Soviet-controlled Eastern Germany as soon as a United Nation can be achieved. All this is clearly specified in the preamble which says that the entire German people is called upon to accomplish, by free self-determination the unity and freedom of Ger, many. . The framers of the constitution  have nailed down their bill of  rights by prescribing penalties for  would-be dictators who by force  of threat of force change the con stitution or deprive the head of  state of his powers, Strange as it , may seem, the most severe penalty . is life imprisonment. The new Germany has abolished  capital punishment. The superstition that finding a horseshoe and nailing it over the door brings good luck appears to be merely a modification of a belief in early times when horseshoes were rare and were believed to have a protective charm.

Two thousand feet and an hour and 20 minutes later the completed car rolled off the assembly line under its own power. . In between were some 700 separate operations and 500 inspections.

I asked the guide if the only job performed by some men all day long was merely to tighten a certain nut as the cars passed. No, he laughed. They usually screw on the nut as well as tighten it. Believing the buyers market is here to stay, Chrysler is emphasizing custom tailoring on its assembly line. In the old days stock cars were modified to meet customer wishes.

Newark, N. J., May 10 --AI-Therell be no hot dogs and ice cream in the world of tomorrow. They are too expensive on a peochemical basis. Thats the prediction of Prof. Eugene G. Rochow of Harvard. But there will be compensations. There may be machines that build your house with earthenware bricks as it digs out the foundation. When you wake up in your new adobe house, youll pull off your pajamas and eat them for breakfast. The professor was awarded a 1,000 prize yesterday for his research in sand derivitives. The ban on hot dogs and ice cream must come, he said, because the world is eating up its resources too fast. Prof. Rochow said meat and eges must disappear from mans diet because the amimals producing them consume too much food So that leaves tenderloin steak out of the picture too in Prof. Rochows bright new chemical world.

The mainstay of mans diet, he told the north Jersey section of the American Chemical Society, would be trees.

Jersey City, N. J., May 10 ---Drenched voters gathered in long lines outside polling places today as Jersey City settled its turbulent municipal election and the political fate of Frank Hague. His supremacy as city and state Democratic leader -posts Hague has held without serious challenge for more than three decades--was listed as the major issue as the muni pality named its new commission government.  Rain fell throughout the early Morning, but nobody in Jersey City seemed to mind, Crowds queued up outside most of the municipalitys polling places, and leaders of all opposing factions agreed there would be at least a -near-record vote. A record registration of 168,000 voters is eligible to vote in todays election, and local leaders Said they expected some 140,000 at. the polls. John V. Kenny, a former trusted lieutenant of Hagues, is furnishing the major opposition to the Democratic organization ticket which is headed by Hagues nephew, a Frank H. Eggers. For the first time since Hague fought his way into Jersey Citys political arena in 1913, he is on the sidelines in a city election. Hague seeks no office today.

Roosevelt in four presidential elections, ae lost prestige in 1948 when Gov. Dewey soundly trounced Pr esident Truman in New Jersey. A defeat in his own city would further undermine Hagues influence.

And, of course, there are the old stories of a corrupt government which cannot have made the sorry lot of the average Chinese any easier. One reputable Waynesboro man, who served in China during the recent war ig an outspoken .critio of the corruption and the weakness of the Nationalist government officials --as well as the Chinese army officers. He declared that from his experfence he served with the Chinese army, training units in the use of American weapons that the average soldier was only loyal to any side as long as he was fed, This observation was made several years ago. It seems to this writer that United States officials should have known ahout this inherent weakness then. Millions of dollars in American taxpayers money could have been saved, This same informer predicted the fall of the Nationalists in 1946, Other Waynesbora men who saw service in the Orient were of the same opinjon, so it was not one mans prediction.

lr SEEMS ON the side of the ridiculous to suggest that huge stockpiles of munitions for war be shifted from bases in the Philippines and Pacific bases to China to be called aid. In Chinas civil war plight, if between political groups or otherwise, it would seem to be more in line with humanity to disafm the warring factions, or permit them to wear their weapons out without replacement.

WASHINGTON, May 10 Wi-The second largest winter wheat crop on record is still in prospect, the agriculture department reported today. Its second forecast of the year put the presently growing crop at 1,021,476,000 bushels. his is about 1,790,000 more than. was predicted a month ago. The department said growth and development of the crop was fostered by April weather conditions in nearly all areas. The estimate raised the possibility of a wheat surplus that might lead to government production controls on the 1950 crop. No Spring Forecast No forecast was given for spring wheat, but if this crop turns out to be at about the same as last years 300,000,000 bushels, the total wheat production this year would be about 1,321,000,000 bushels. The record is 1,367,186,000 produced in 1947, when world shortages were acute. There is a reserve or carryover of about 300,000,000 bushels of old-crop wheat. Thus the total supply for the marketing year ahead, on the basis of todays estimate, would be about 1,621,000,000 bushels. Perhaps not more than 1,200,000,000 will be needed, officials said, for domestic and  export needs, Acreage Allotment The department is preparing plans for acreage allotment on next years wheat crop. They would call for a cut of between 15 and 25 percent in the planted acreage, depending on how large this years crop turns out to be. The department said progress of the 1949 crop season was. encouraging on May 1. Earlier delays in interior portions of the country were mostly offset by rapid progress in field work during the latter third of April. Conditions for seeding spring wheat have been mostly favorable, wth little to prevent actual planting from reaching earlier plans, OMAHA, May 10 P--The de. partment of agriculture today dropped its sights on Nebraskas 1949 winter wheat crop by more than 15 million bushels. As late as a month ago a crop af 78,872,000 bushels was indicated.

The Republicans look on it as hardening the differences between the President and other Southern Democrats as well as Senator Byrd D., Va.-the only Byrd in Senate or House. Now this leap ram patronage to purge. Arends said, clearly indicates that the President is planning a third term attempt. He cant purge the Virginia senator until 1953 and he cant purge if he isnt around so it looks like he is getting set for the race in 1952. And it may be, Mr. Speaker, that the patronage to purge mancuver will turn out to be quite a hurdle and the warbles from the mocking birds--b-i-r-d-s--in Congress wont be sweet to his ears. SITUATION CLARIFIED Actually, Truman has been elected to only one presidential term, He went to the White House as the successor of the late President Rooseveli.

He wants us to see that congressmen are elected who are able to see these things in dhe terms of national interest, rather. than loval interest and to make large plans rather than small plans. Replying, Byrd said Im going 10 continue to make some small moncy plans that the President wont like at all. BIG FLAN, TOO And Ive got an interest in a big plan, too. Im going to see 4o it, if Iocan, that the Senate doesnt confirm the nomination of Mon Wall- gren to head the National Security Resources Board. Hes definitely not, big enough for that job. Byrd furnished the necessary Democratic vote when Republicans on the Senate Armed Services ComMittee bottled up the Wallgren appointment weeks ago. In a formal statement on the intident, Byrd said. I owe my al legiance to my constituency in Vir-, ginia, So long as I remain in the Senate, I will vote as my conscience dictates and to represent the wishes of my constituents. Byrds friends said the Presidents erack probably will make the Virginijan more solid than ever with the voters of his state. They usually resent outside interference in their choice of officials, If any serious purge attempt isecmed likely, Byrd would be al- most certain to seek return to the Ecnate when his present lerm expiras in 1952. He has been talking of retiring at that time, WHERE TO EINS IT

I owe allegiance to my constituency in Virginia. So long as I remain in the senate I will vote as my conscience dictates and to represent the wishes of my constituents. Against Spending. During his 16 years in the senate Byrd has had no qualms about bucking the White House. He often votes with the Republicans against administration spending measures.

Washington, May 10.--4--The reported crack by President Truman that there are too many Byrds in Congress spurred Senator Byrd D-Va. and his friends to arm themselves today against a possible purge movement. Asserting that if the President wants to purge me from the senate, Ill be around when the purging starts, Byrd said he intends to keep fighting for the slash in spending he doesnt think the President wants. Gilbert Harrison, national commander, of the American Veterans committee, quoted the President after a White House conference yesterday. Harrison said He told us there were too many Byrds in Congress. He wants us to see that congressmen are elected who are able to see these things in the terms of national interest, rather than local interest and to make large plans rather than small plans. Replying, Byrd said Im going to continue to make some small money plans that the President wont like at all. And Ive got an interest in a big plan, too. Im going to see to it, if I can, that the senate doesnt confirm the nomination of Mon Wallgren to head the National Security resources board. Hes definitely not big enough tor that job. Byrd furnished the necessary Democratic vote when Republicans on the senate armed services committee bottled up the Wallgren appointment weeks ago. Since that time, the Virginian has not been on good political terms with the President, who has said repeatedly that he wants Wallgren confirmed for the post. The Presidents reputed remarks about Byrd were criticized by Senator Wherry of Nebraska, the Republican floor leader. The Prsident notwithstanding, Wherry said, We need the Harry Byrd kind of men in the United States Senate. If the fiscal policy of the President is not halted, it will lead to printing press money or to wartime taxes, one or the other. Senator Ellender D-La said he doesnt agree with the President. T just wish we had more men of Harry Byrds type in the senate, Ellender said. If we dont. have some economy in zovernment, were going to be headed for financial bankruptey. In a formal statement on the incident, Byrd said I owe my alliance to my constituency in Virginia. So long as I remain in the senate, I will vote as my conscience dictates and to represent the wishes of my  constituents. Byrds friends said the Presidents crack probably will make the Virginian more  solid than ever with the voters of his state. They usually resent outside interference in their choice of officials. If any serious purge attempt seemed likely, Byrd would be almost certain to seek return to the senate when his present term expires in 1952. He has been talking of retiring at that time. The Byrd incident was regarded as demonstrating a new irritation on the part of the President at those within his party who do not go along with his legislative program. Recently, Mr. Truman tried to crack the patronage whip on members of congress who oppose his measures. His indication that those who dont go along wont have a say in doling out federal jobs seemed to have been modified later by statements of other Democratic officials.
