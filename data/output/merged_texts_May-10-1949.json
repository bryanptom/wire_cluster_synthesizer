            "Chinese Nationalists claimed a victory today in their counter-offensive against Red troops pressing towards Shanghai. A nationalist garrison communique said its troops had gained an advantage over Communist forces at the village of Liuho, 30 miles northwest of Shanghai. Military observers in Shanghai expressed belief the action was a small one, however. Nationalist forces also counter-attacked west of Kunshan yesterday driving back a Communist unit. The Shanghai garrison asserted 200 casualties were inflicted on the Reds in this action. North of Kunshan 1,000 Reds struck at Taichang, but Nationalists claimed the Communists were hurled back with 200 killed. No reports have been received about the Kashing front where a Red spearhead is moving toward Shanghai. Nor was there any mention of the central or south China fronts where the communists have been driving into Kiangsi and Chekiang provinces."

After the drop it was still four per cent above March, 1948. The Commerce Department, reporting this today, said March consumer income fell 2,000,000,000 below February to an annual rate of 214,300,000,000. Declines in wages and salaries, easily the biggest item of consumer income, and in receipts of owners of farms and unincorporated businesses were chiefly responsible. They were partly offset, however, by increased unemployment compensation payments. The term consumer income, as used by the government, means practically ali income received by individuals as distinguished from income received by corporations. Besides payrolls and earnings of unincorporated businesses, it includes such things as net rents going to landlords, dividends and interest received by securities owners, and social security payments, The department said payrolls showed in March the biggest drop so far in 1949, but that the coal mine holiday caused the fall to be greater than in January and February. Layoffs and shortening of the work week in many manufacturing plants accounted for most of the reduction in wage and salary receipts to a 132,400,000,000 annual rate in March.

            "DETROIT, May 10 AP-The Ford strike idling 65,000 -and threatening as many more -was carried to the peace table today. On the sixth day of the of the speed-up deadlock, management and the CIO United Auto Workers sought a solution together, Their initial negotiations were set for 2 p. m. In keeping with other events of this first major labor battle in a year in the auto industry, the agreement to negotiate Monday with dramatic suddenness. suddenness. Young President Henry Ford II, acting swiftly, accepted a proposal for talks from President Walter Reuther of the union. The two acted as strike-caused layoffs in Ford and supplier firms already were mounting into the thousands. A full 40,000 more Ford workers face idleness within a week if the strike is not settled. Ford has warned it may have to shut down all its 49 plants. In agreeing to negotiations Ford said his company assumed that the talks would be continued until this strike can be brought to a close. He declined two accompanying proposals from Reuther, however. Ford said he would neither appear personally at the negotiations nor would he engage in a public debate with Reuther if the dispute werent settled by Friday. The red-haired union chief, in a public statement later, deplored Fords answer on those two counts, but he carried the matter no further. It was only a little more than two hours after receiving Reuthers invitation to negotiate that Ford returned his formal assent. Almost immediately the initial session was arranged--in the same Detroit building where the futile peace talks of last Thursday collapsed shortly after the strike deadline last Thursday. Declining Reuthers proposal for a debate, Ford said nothing useful could be accomplished. The union president had suggested that he and Ford meet on a rostrum in Briggs stadium, home of the Detroit Tigers baseball team, before a mass meeting of Ford workers. The issues, Ford said, must be resolved on their merits and by conscientious effort at the bargaining table by both parties, and not by emotional appeals. Reuther asked Fords personal presence at the negotiations so that he would be apprized of team in the previous the situation which you obviously do not have. However, Ford said he was leaving the negotiations to John S. Bugas, vice president in charge of industrial relations who headed the company team in the previous party. As Ford negotiations gave rise to hopes for peace on that dispute, there was other trouble in the industry. Chrysler announced an indefinite layoff of 22,000 workers because of a shortage of windows stemming from a reported slowdown in a supplier plant. Chrysler shut down final assemblies at its Dodge, De De and Chrysler main plants and passenger car and body making at its Chrysler Kercheval avenue plant.",

The Lords planned to bring the measure--main item in the labor governments socialist program-to early consideration. It is expected generally the upper chamber will riddle it with amendments, and return it to Commons which then will restore it virtually to present form, to become law. Socialists call the bill an attack on the heart of capitalism, because control of iron and steel means control essentially of British manufacturing, from bicycles to battleships. The bill, proposed by the Labor government, went to the House of Lords after a Conservative motion in Commons to reject it was defeated 330-203. It authorizes the government to buy the stock of 107 companies, but actual direction of the companies would stay in the hands of the men who run them now as private enterprises.

The labor government, whose platform pledges public ownership of key industries, has delayed moving in on iron and steel for four vears. In that period it nationalized coal, electricity, railroads, long distance truck and gas industries, airlines and the Bank of England. The labor party has marked for",

            "In the congressional district where I live, a special election is being held to elect a representative to replace the colorful Sol Bloom, who recently died. The election would have passed unnoticed except for the self-interjection of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., son of the father by the same name. Junior apparently regards this as a golden opportunity to begin a political career. Four candidates are running The aforesaid Roosevelt on the Liberal party ticket and some improvisation called the four freedoms party. Nobody ever heard of this new thing -something pulled together by petition to give Junior a second line on the ballot so that those who refuse to vote for the Liberal party have another means for voting for him. The Republicans have nominated William H. McIntyre, an official of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The Democrats have nominated Judge Benjamin Shalleck, a distinguished lawyer and judge who most nearly is representative of the people of the district. The Communists have presented us with Dr. Annette Rubinstein, who is fighting Stalins battles on upper Broadway. Young Roosevelt wanted the Democratic nomination. He worked to get it. He tried to force himself on the Democratic party. They turned him down for the good reason that he does not belong he is an outsider and represents nothing but his fathers name, which may or may not be a political asset depending on how the wind blows around May 17, when the election is to be held. Franklin Roosevelt, Jr. never lived in this district. There is no reason why he should know the people of it or their problems. He is neither by ancestry, birth, education, interests nor habits a part of them. His only excuse for wanting to represent them is that he wants to. He apparently dares not run in his own district, which is on the other side of town where the rich live. We are essentially a middle-class district, mostly of Jewish and Irish ancestry. Sol Bloom fitted this district perfectly so would either Judge Shalleck or Mr. McIntyre. When Roosevelt could not get the Democratic nomination, he took one from David Dubinskys Liberal party. While most of the inhabitants of this district respect David Dubinsky, they think of him as a labor leader, not as a politician handing out nominations. Besides, Dubinsky does not live in our district any more than Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. does. It seems to many that we should be permitted to manage our own affairs, to have as our representative in Congress, a neighbor, one of our own kind, who knows what our special problems are and will act accordingly. That is the business of a representative, as intended by the Constitution, and we understand it. So, when Junior decided to run for Congress and picked us, he took a room in the Esplanade hotel, which is right opposite the tenement in which I live. I have not asked the elevator boys how often he has been there because I am not a snooper, but this hotel is not his normal habitat. Without any reflection on the hotel or its guests or on my block or my neighbors,",
            "cannot imagine his picking this particular part of town to live in. Neither his father, his mother nor any of his brothers ever did and Junior never did until he decided that congress needs a Roosevelt and he picked himself. Personally, I shall not vote for him. He does not belong here. I am puzzled whether many who would ordinarily vote for Mr. McIntyre will not, in this election, vote for Judge Shalleck to make sure that Junior does not slip in. But of this I am certain I shall not vote for an interloper like Junior who suddenly becomes a friend of my people up here and tries to talk like one of us, which he isnt. A representative in congress should be of the people of the district he should be of the warp and woof of that district, not somebody who takes a room in a hotel a few weeks before election day.
