            "Chinese Nationalists claimed a victory today in their counter-offensive against Red troops pressing towards Shanghai. A nationalist garrison communique said its troops had gained an advantage over Communist forces at the village of Liuho, 30 miles northwest of Shanghai. Military observers in Shanghai expressed belief the action was a small one, however. Nationalist forces also counter-attacked west of Kunshan yesterday driving back a Communist unit. The Shanghai garrison asserted 200 casualties were inflicted on the Reds in this action. North of Kunshan 1,000 Reds struck at Taichang, but Nationalists claimed the Communists were hurled back with 200 killed. No reports have been received about the Kashing front where a Red spearhead is moving toward Shanghai. Nor was there any mention of the central or south China fronts where the communists have been driving into Kiangsi and Chekiang provinces."
