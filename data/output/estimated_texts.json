A Nationalist garrison communique said its troops had gained an advantage over Communist forces at the village of Liuho, 30 miles northwest of Shanghai. Military observers in Shanghai expressed belief the action was a small one, however. Nationalist forces also counter-attacked west of Kunshan yesterday driving back a Communist unit. The Shanghai garrison asserted 200 casualties were inflicted on the Reds in this action. North of Kunshan 1,000 Reds struck at Taichang, but Nationalists claimed the Communists were hurled back with 200 killed. No reports have been received about the Kashing front where a Red spearhead is moving toward Shanghai. Nor was there any mention of the central or south China fronts where the communists have been driving into Kiangsi and Chekiang provinces.",

The youngster, who suffered probable skull fractures when struck by a car Saturday, was given artificial respiration by doctors who refused to concede the child was dead. The treatment plus injection of a heart stimulant started him breathing again. Physicians explained the boy stopped breathing because of extreme shock and fat embolism escaping from bone marrow. They added it has been unsafe to move him for x-rays. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Francis Mack Page of Mojave, Calif., have been at his bedside constantly.",

        "text": "May 10--(P)-Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress threw support today behind a reported recommendation by President Truman's council of economic advisers for a cut in government spending. The council was said to have held that because of unsettled business conditions it would be safer to trim spending than to try any sharp tax increase. Responsible officials said the economists went even further--to suggest the possibility of cutting some excise taxes and of delaying six months a 'social security payroll tax boost scheduled for July 1. Each of these proposals got considerable backing from the lawmakers. But the final decision on which way to turn in the face of obviously increasing financial pressure on the nation's economy rests with Mr. Truman. Thus far he has refused to back down on his repeated demands for $4,000,000,000 in new taxes. The economic advisers were said to have urged the president to accept a 'lesser goal' than this. Chairman George (D-Ga) of the senate finance committee said the advisory report--delivered to the White House last week but not yet formally made public--confirms the position he has taken. 'If the national income is shrinking because business is is shrinking, it would be nonsense to clap more taxes on a falling economy,' George told a reporter. 'Our only hope is to cut expenditures.' The economic advisers were re ported to have found that no major part of the nation's economy is in serious trouble now, but that there are hazards ahead which must be watched closely-particularly the possibility of fourth round wage increases and top-heavy crop surpluses. Some lawmakers say they think the current price slump goes deeper than government department reports indicate. One of these, Sen. Brewster",

        "text": "May 10 -Consumer income dropped in March for the third consecutive month, falling three per cent below the peak reached last December. After the drop it was still four per cent above March, 1948. The Commerce Department, reporting this today, said March consumer income fell $2,000,000,000 below February to an annual rate of $214,300,000,000. Declines in wages and salaries, easily the biggest item of consumer income, and in receipts of owners of farms and unincorporated businesses were chiefly responsible. They were partly offset, however, by increased unemployment compensation payments. The term 'consumer income,' as used by the government, means practically all income received by individuals as distinguished from income received by corporations. Besides payrolls and earnings of unincorporated businesses, it includes such things as net rents going to landlords, dividends and interest received by securities owners, and social security payments. The department said payrolls showed in March the biggest drop so far in 1949, but that the coal mine 'holiday' caused the fall to be greater than in January and February. Layoffs and shortening of the work week in many manufacturing plants accounted for most of the reduction in wage and salary receipts to a $132,400,000,000 annual rate in March. The rate was $134,700,000,000 in February.",

        "text": "May 10 (4)--The Ford strike idling 65,000 men--and threatening as many more -was carried to the peace table today. On the sixth day of the 'speedup' deadlock management and the CIO United Auto Workers sought a solution together. Their initial negotiations were set for 2 p. m. (EST). In keeping with other events of this first major labor battle in a year in the auto industry, the agreement to negotiate came yesterday with dramatic suddenness. Young President Henry Ford II, acting swiftly, accepted a proposal for talks from President Walter Reuther of the union. The two acted as strike-caused layoffs in Ford and supplier firms already were mounting into the thousands. A full 40,000 more Ford workers face idleness within a week if the strike is not settled. Ford has warned it may have to shut down all its 49 plants. In agreeing to negotiations Ford said his company assumed that the talks would be 'continued until this strike can be brought to a close.' He declined two accompanying proposals from Reuther, however. Ford said he would neither appear personally at the negotiations nor would he engage in a public debate with Reuther if the dispute weren't settled by Friday. The red-haired union chief, ir a public statement later, deplored Ford's answer on those two counts, but he carried the matter no further. It was only a little more than two hours after receiving Reuther's invitation to negotiate that Ford returned his formal assent. Almost immediately the initial session was arranged--in the same Detroit building where the futile peace talks of last Thursday collapsed shortly after the strike deadline last Thursday. Declining Reuther's proposal for a debate, Ford said 'nothing useful' could be accomplished. The union president had suggested that he and Ford meet on a rostrum in Briggs stadium, home of the Detroit Tigers baseball team, before a mass meeting of Ford workers. 'The issues,' Ford said, 'must be resolved on their merits and by conscientious effort at the bargaining table by both parties, and not by emotional appeals.' Reuther asked Ford's personal presence at the negotiations so that he would be 'apprized of all the facts in the situation which you obviously do not have.' However, Ford said he was leaving the negotiations to John S.",

        "text": "Aiming to spike Communist propaganda claims, the United States today offered official wartime evidence that American troops were ready to free the capitol of Czechoslovakia, but held back at Russia's request. The state department made public records bearing on the point because Moscow and the Czech Communists have been giving Russia all the credit for the liberation of Prague from the Nazis four years ago. Among the documents released yesterday was a Soviet request to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower to halt his fast-moving American troops at Pilsen, some 50 miles short of the Czech capital. Eisenhower complied. Four days later the Soviet army routed the last Nazis from Prague. In taking the U. S.-Russian messages out of storage, the State department said that the American forces were acting for military purposes--in this case to avoid confusion with the approaching Red army--not for political reasons. In a message dated May 4, 1945, Eisenhower notified the Russian high command that his forces were ready to sweep on to the Elbe and Vitava rivers and thus enter the valley in which Prague is situated. The next day brought this prompt letter from Gen. Antonov, chief of the Red army general staff: 'The Soviet command requests General Eisenhower to refrain from advancing the Allied forces in Czechoslovakia beyond the formerly designated line.' That line ran through the towns of Karlsbad, Pilsen and Budweis--and that's where the U. S. troops halted their advance. The state department said it published the texts--paraphrased because they were taken from secret coded documents--because of the 'many false statements and interpretations' surrounding the episode. Moscow has long sought to make political capital out of the claim that it was Russia which really destroyed Hitler's war machine, while the western allies set up their second front only to win a share of the spoils.",

'Tam not an expert,' Mrs. Gehrig said, 'but it is a tragic fact that my testimony on this subject is almost as authoritative as as that of any doctor in the land. 'This is not an indication of my erudition.

'As the disease progressed,' she continued, 'he couldn't dress himself, he couldn't feed himself, he couldn't walk. 'Two years after he hung up his old Yankee uniform for the last time, he died.'

        "text": "-A hotly-disputed bill to nationalize most of Britain's iron and steel industry went to the House of Lords today. It was passed last night by the House of Commons. The Lords planned to bring the measure--main item in the labor government's Socialist program--to early consideration. It is expected generally the upper chamber will riddle it with amendments, and return it to Commons which then will restore it virtually to present form, to become law. Socialists call the bill an 'attack on the heart of capitalism,' because control of iron and steel means control essentially of British manufacturing, from bicycles to battleships. The bill, proposed by the Labor government, went to the House of Lords after a Conservative motion in Commons to reject it was defeated 330-203. It authorizes the government to buy the stock of 107 companies, but actual direction of the companies would stay in the hands of the men who run them now as private enterprises. The companies would work under a government holding corporation, retaining their present firm names. They would be free to compete with one another, but not to the point of clashing with the holding corporation's overall general plan. Under the measure the government would pay $1,200,000,000 for the stock of the 107 companies. The firms, which employ 300,000 of Britain's 495,000 iron and steel workers, are capitalized at 195,000,000 pounds ($780,000,000). The bill calls for government control of the affected plants to start May 1, 1950--just before next summer's scheduled national elections. Some well-placed sources, however, say the takeover may be deferred until the elections have shown whether the people really are firmly behind the Labor party's plans for government control of industry. The labor government, whose platform pledges public ownership of key industries, has delayed moving in on iron and steel for four vears. In that period it nationalized coal, electricity, railroads, long distance truck and gas industries, airlines and the Bank of England. The labor party has marked",
