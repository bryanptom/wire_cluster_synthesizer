The Democrats\nhave nominated Judge Benjamin\nShalleck, a distinguished lawyer\nand judge who most nearly is\nrepresentative of the people of\nthe district. The Communists have\npresented us with Dr. Annette\nRubinstein, who is fighting Sta-\nlin's battles on upper Broadway.\n\nYoung Roosevelt wanted the\nDemocratic nomination. He work-\ned to get it. He tried to force him-\nself on the Democratic party.\nThey turned him down for the\ngood reason that he does not be-\nlong: he is an outsider and repre-\nsents nothing but his father's\nname, which may or may not be\na political asset depending on how\nthe wind blows around May 17,\nwhen the election is to be held,\n\nFranklin Roosevelt, Jr. never\nlived in this district. There is no\nreason why he should know the\npeople of it or their problems. He\nis neither by ancestry, mirth, edu-\ncation, interests nor habits a part\nof them. His only excuse for\nwanting to represent them is that\nhe wants to. He apparently dares\nnot run in his own district, which\nis on the other side of town where\nthe rich live. We are essentially\na middle-class district, mostly of\nJewish and Irish ancestry. Sol\nBloom fitted this district perfect-\n ly; so would either Judge Shal-\nleck or Mr. McIntyre.\n\nWhen Roosevelt could not get\nthe Democratic nomination, he\ntook one from David Dubinsky\u2019s\nLiberal party. While most of the\ninhabitants of this district respect\nDavid Dubinsky, they think of\nhim as a labor leader, not as a\npolitician handing out nomina-\ntions. Besides, Dubinsky does not\nlive in our district any more than\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. does.\nIt seems to many that we should\nbe permitted to manage our own\naffairs, to have as our represen-\ntative in Congress, a neighbor,\none of our own kind, who knows\nwhat our special problems are and\nwill act accordingly. That is the\nbusiness of a representative, as\nintended by the Constitution, and\nwe understand it.\n\nSo, when Junior decided to run\nfor Congress and picked us, he\ntook a room in the Esplanade ho-\ntel, which is right opposite the\ntenement in which I live. I have\nnot asked the elevator boys how\noften he has been there because\nI am not a snooper, but this hotel\nis not his normal habitat. With-\nout any reflection on the hotel or\nits guests or on my block or my\nneighbors, | cannot imagine his\npicking this particular part of\ntown to live in. Neither his fath-\ner, his mother or any of his bro-\nthers ever did and Junior never\ndid until he decided that Con-\ngress needs a Roosevelt and he\npicked himself\n\nPersonally, 1 shall not vote for\nhim. He does not belong here.\nI am puzzled whether many who\nwould ordinarily vote for Mr. Me-\nIntyre will not, in this election,\nvote for Judge Shalleck to make\nsure that Junior does not slip in.\nBut of this I am certain: I shall\nnot vote for an interloper like\nJunior who suddenly becomes a\nfriend of my people up here and\ntries to talk like one of us, which\nhe isn't\n\nA representative in Congress\nshould be of the people of the\ndistrict; he should be of the warp\nand woof of that district, not\nsomebody who takes a room in a\n\u2014 a few weeks before election\nay.\n "
