In earlier U.S. manned space\nflights, the astronauts were plucked by\nhelicopter from their floating spaceships.\n\nSpeed in retrieving the astronauts is es-\nsential because doctors are keenly in-\nterested in their initial reaction to earth\ngravity after four weeks\u2019 exposure to\nweightlessness.\n\n\u201cIn general, the three crewmen are in\ngood health,\u201d\u2019 said Dr. Royce Hawkins,\nthe astronauts\u2019 chief ohvsician, Thursday.\n\nlesting just how well man can with-\nstand the deconditioning effects of living\nfor long periods in space is one of the\nmain obiectives of the Skylab program.\n\nTwo more missions are planned, with\nthe Skylab 2 and 3 crews scheduled to\nrocket up to the laboratory on July 27 and\nin October. They'll remain aboard for 56\ndays each, continuing the medical, earth\nresources, solar astronomy, space\nmanufacturing and other experiments\nstarted by the first crew.\n\nLike vacationers closing a summer\nhouse, Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz on\nThursday cleaned up the space station for\nSkylab 2.

That\ndifficulty was the result of an earher\nmaneuver designed to warm up what\nappeared to be a frozen space station\nradiator\n\nThe primary objective of the orbital\n marathon was to see how well men fare\nfor long periods in weightlessness and\nthen adjust to the stress of the\ndeceleration into earth's atmosphere and\nthe rigors of gravity. Hinging on the\nmedical results are plans to send two\nmore crews up to Skvlab for 56 davs\neach.\n\nThe first medical results from Conrad.\nKerwin and Weitz were expected late\ntoday after doctors complete six-hour\nphysical examinations in special, blue\nmobile laboratories mounted on the\ncarrier's hangar deck.\n\nIn-flight tests showed the astronauts\u2019\nhearts had developed laziness as ex-\npected in the relative easy environment\nof weightlessness. Doctors planned to\nmeasure the extent of this decon.\nditioning. Other tests were designed to\nmeasure the loss of calcium from bones,\nbody fluid loss, blood changes and other\nspaceflight reactions.\n\nThe pilots brought frozen blood and\nbody waste specimens with them to help\nmedical scientists conduct the most\n detailed physiological tests ever con-\nducted on returning spacemen.\n\nTheir command module also was\nloaded with film canisters holding 30,000\nof the best pictures of the sun ever taken,\nmore than 14,000 earth resources\nphotographs and nine miles of magnetic\ntape that recorded other earth sensing\ndata. ;\n\nAlso removed from the eightroom\nspace station were numerous other ex-\nperiment results. a few broken parts,\nfood samples and films showing the new\nway of life aboard Skylab.\n\nThe next Skylab crew, meanwhile, was\nin Huntsville, Ala., today practicing\nspacewalk activities in the large water\ntank that Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz used\nto prepare for their work outside the\nspacecraft.\n\nSkylab 2 astronauts Alan L.
